lasionycteris_altavela,85,90,88,publishable as is.,"The analysis is clear and reasonable, with valid statistical choices.

Some additional explanation of choices made would be helpful.  For example, the code creates Formant and Pitch objects, but only uses intensity in the analysis.  This is not at all unreasonable, but a comment on the reasoning would be useful.

Similarly, only NF trials are considered, excluding AF and ANF trials.  Again there may be valid reasons for doing so, but some discussion is warranted.

The choice to find the maximum intensity of the utterance rather than of individual words is again reasonable, but some discussion would be appropriate.",The use of a linear mixed model is in line with norms in the field.,"Variables: as mentioned above, some reasoning behind the focus on only intensity, when other measures were collected, would be helpful.

Model: The only question about the model is that in the comment in the code above the model definition, it says that a random slope of typicality is included, but I don't see any random slopes at all in the model definition, and typicality is included as a fixed effect.

While not strictly necessary, some model comparison or discussion thereof would be useful to see if the random effects are justified.","The use of maximum intensity makes sense, but some discussion of why that variable was chosen over other measures of focus/stress would be appropriate, especially since Praat Pitch and Formant objects were created.",The model structure is suitable.,"The only items excluded were those with text in the ""notes"" tier of the TextGrids.  There are a few outliers in Intensity if defining outlier as ±2sd from the mean, but there are none at ±3sd from the mean, so it is reasonable to not exclude any of these data.","No transformations were done to the data.  The only consideration here is that typ_mean has a strange distribution—many values of 100% and 0%, with values in the middle skewing right, but it is reasonable to not apply a transformation.",NA,3
lasionycteris_altavela,40,70,60,publishable with major revision.,"Phonetic analysis: 
This analysis looked at maximum intensity over each entire sentence.
Intensity is a relatively inconsistent cue, compared to fundamental frequency or duration, to prosodic focus and stress. It is not clear from the methods document how precisely the recordings were made, but based on impressionistic auditory inspection of the recordings it appears that the participants did not necessarily have a constant distance between the mouth and the microphone. This makes any estimation of intensity inherently unreliable.
There is also no guarantee that the intensity peaks occurred during the target noun phrase, rather than elsewhere in the sentence.
Statistical analysis: 
The model overall appears to be well-constructed and well-though-out. The checking of model assumptions is an excellent inclusion. However there are some causes for concern.
The description of the model mentioned a random slope for typicality, but this does not appear to have been included in the model.
The statistical model has a random effect of “target_name”, which corresponds to the noun’s identity, but it does not have a random effect of “target_colour”, which corresponds to the adjective’s identity. Ideally this should have been justified or explained. (As it happens, inclusion of this random effect leads to a singular fit, as the adjective does not appear to have a substantial effect on intensity. Nevertheless this should have been justified.)
The statistical model appears to compile with a warning of a singular fit. This appears to be due to the random intercept of speaker:item, which has a variance of zero. Removing this random intercept leads to no convergence error, and does not substantially alter the pattern of results.
The data included was apparently only the NF trials. However, examination of the data shows that there’s a mismatch between the “label” and “condition” columns, such that the “label” column incorrectly lists every token as “NF”, even though many are actually “ANF” or “AF”. This might be a bug in the R/Praat code that generates the “label” column. (The “condition” column appears to consistently match the actual data in the textgrids.) Fixing this problem (by changing the subset code to refer to the “condition” column rather than the “label” column) does not appear to substantially alter the results.","A linear mixed effect regression model was used to analyze the data, which is appropriate.","The choice of IVs was reasonable, although more attention could have been paid to the singular fit issue. The choice of DV was questionable – as discussed above, there are better measurements (such as f0 or duration) that could have been made, and done so more carefully.",See above.,"The statistical model was fine in principle, although more attention could have been paid to the singular fit issue.","The analysis (ostensibly) included the data from the NF focus conditions, and excluded tokens marked as “error”. This is reasonable (aside from the bug which caused non-NF tokens to be included in the data.)",No transformations were made. It may have been helpful to center the intensity data around zero before entering it into the model but it is unlikely that this would have affected the conclusions in a meaningful way.,No further comments,1
lasionycteris_altavela,55,65,60,publishable with major revision.,"The analysis, while correct, appears overly simple. The textgrids were used without any modifications, which made it impossible to distinguish measurements in the relevant parts of the sentence from these at the repeated carrier phrase. The choice of the main measurement, i.e. peak intensity at the sentence level is problematic: the identified peak might lie in the carrier phrase. Finally, it could have been more interesting to model the intensity curve instead of just a maximum point.",The choice of an LMER model seems correct.,"The choice of peak intensity as the dependent variable is justified to some extent, but the choice of the whole sentence as the target of the phonetic analysis is not. Mean typicality is used as the independent variable, but the decision to use the numerical variable and not the categorical one is not sufficiently justified.","The model includes the random effect of the target noun, but not of the adjective or any other word. This is done under the assumption that the peak intensity will always be found in the noun for the NF condition. The rationale behind this is not entirely convincing.","Including varying slope (1|filename:target_name) apparently causes singularity issues, not mentioned in the report. The results reported are in fact for the model without this random effect and only with the reported random intercepts, ie lmer(Intensity ~ typ_mean + (1|target_name)+ (1|filename)).","Only noun focus data was included, which is appropriate. Trials including notes in the textgrids were excluded. This may not be enough. Our team had to mark extra sentences as errors or hesitation breaks in addition to the ones already marked as such in the provided textgrids. Errors and hesitation could affect the measurements.","The data was not transformed. We would recommend a by-speaker normalisation of the intensity values, because the intercept-only speaker random effect cannot account for all the variability between speakers.","The confidence intervals and pseudo R2 values appear a bit surprising (“pseudo R2 < .001 95% CI [.000, .999]”).

lasionycteris_altavela,50,75,55,publishable with major revision.,"We had some difficulties interpreting what this group has done exactly, because of the rather minimal reporting. For example, it did not become fully clear to us which segments exactly were used (we assume sentences), similarly which trials were used, and on which part of the segment the intensity was measured precisely. We also wonder why focus-conditions were not explicitly taken into account during analysis. And we missed a proper discussion of the findings. All this makes it difficult to fully appreciate the results. We do understand the choice to concentrate on intensity, and this is also properly motivated in the document. And, we do really appreciate the explicit description of which r-packages were used. The authors appear to be well-versed in the statistical analysis, hence our relatively high rating of this aspect of the analysis.",The use of a linear mixed effect model makes sense,This is all done very well,It makes sense to focus on intensity (as we note above) even though there are also other variables that could have been taken into account,This is fine,There is very little information about this,Not applicable,NA,1

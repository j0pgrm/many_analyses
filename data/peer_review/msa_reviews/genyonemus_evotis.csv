genyonemus_evotis,85,70,73,publishable with minor revision.,"While the techniques for dimensionality reduction and analysis of acoustic features seem solid to us, we are not so sure about the overall approach. This team took an exploratory approach that included many acoustic dimensions (increasing the chances of a significant result somewhere). It was difficult for us to evaluate the conclusions and think it must be framed as exploratory rather than confirmatory.","See comments above on the overall approach, otherwise the use of the GLMM as the final analysis seems appropriate.",Selection of the variable is appropriate given the overall approach.,"This analysis used a holistic meta-variable instead of a single acoustic measure as dv, but then attempt to make conclusions about the individual acoustic features in the end. Our main concern is that it's unclear how the authors chose which acoustic measurements to initially extract, and there were so many acoustic measurements used in the acoustic feature analysis that something was bound to be significant in the model.",Structure is appropriate given the approach,"The authors chose not to exclude data without typicality ratings and instead manually coded typicality for those items. They discuss how they did this, but don't provide a justification as to why. This also causes them to change the structure of the model to be binomial because some of the conditions only have (as they manually assigned) ""typical"" or ""atypical"" levels. We found the inclusion of these data unnecessary because (as far as we can tell) the items for which typicality was not coded were not designed to bear on this question.","z-score was used during feature selection to make graphs to compare across participants, which we found appropriate.  However, it was unclear whether this transform was used on the data included in the GLMMs (which includes random intercepts for speaker, so z-scores are potentially unnecessary there).","We don't see any space to comment on data processing. The authors don't mention any attempt to check the accuracy of the force aligned measurements, which could greatly affect the results.",2
genyonemus_evotis,90,80,85,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis seems sensible, but I should disclose that I am not familiar with the kind of analysis performed by the authors. This is reflected in my review below, which should be taken cautiously.","The statistical model per se (i.e., the binomial regression) seems like a sensible choice, although a discussion of issues related to multiple comparisons or over-fitting is missing. Indeed, the authors included a large number of predictors in the GLM in a theory-blind fashion, and report the significant predictors (i.e., the predictors with a p-value lower than .05). However, even if none of the predictor is truly (i.e., in the population) associated with typicality (the outcome), it is expected that some predictors will get a significant p-value, just because of random sampling. A more appropriate alternative would have been to fit several theoretically-sound models and to compare them (e.g., using information criteria).",This issue has been discussed just above: I am worried that some significant associations may just be false positives.,This issue has been discussed just above: I am worried that some significant associations may just be false positives.,"The likelihood choie seems sensible, but I am worried that some significant associations may just be false positives.",I am not competent to evaluate the pre-processing.,I am not competent to evaluate the pre-processing.,"As mentioned previously, the phonetic analysis seems sensible, but I should disclose that I am not familiar with the kind of analysis performed by the authors. This is reflected in my review below, which should be taken cautiously.",2
genyonemus_evotis,70,70,70,publishable with major revision.,"Phonetic ratings: The authors use a blanket term of F0 and several speech properties, but they do not provide clear details for the justification of these different properties, particularly the harmonics. The authors note that time-course should not be examined, but this was not clear why, since lengthening could be a potential way to signal typicality in speech.

The use of a forced aligner may be a good choice for parsing large amounts of data, but it was not clear whether any of the data were hand coded or examined to ensure accuracy. The method of alignment and data extraction was not particularly detailed, and it is not clear whether another team could replicate the data extraction based on the description. 

There were some points in the analysis that were unclear as to whether the authors were making judgments about typicality in line with the original norming study or using additional metrics.

The authors provided very detailed visual analyses of the data. However, the motivation and method of the visualization was not explained in enough detail to be accessible to a non-expert, and there was so much data that it was overwhelming at times. In addition, it was unclear how the visualizations were integrated into the logistic regression and the interpretation of the analysis. For example, if the visualizations had led to no clear differences in typicality, would the model still be run in the same way?","The logistic regression is a standard analysis tool in the field, but it is unclear how such a large model should be interpreted","Comparing typicality by acoustic feature seems appropriate, but there was some confusion as to why the data were divided among the three focus conditions, and how the different focus conditions integrated into the analysis/hypothesis, since the NF focus condition was the critical condition. Since many of the acoustic features are highly related (e.g., the various harmonics), it was not clear whether these should have been grouped separately.","It seemed appropriate to include all the variables that were extracted from the speech stream for comparison, but (as noted above), it was not entirely clear why all of those were included.",The model makes use of a very minimal random effects structure. More discussion is needed about the choice of this random effects structure rather than a more complex model (with random slopes and additional random intercepts) instead of a model with a large number of fixed effects (without interactions).,"The authors note that data above 97.5% and below 2.5% should be excluded, which seems like a reasonable choice. It is not clear whether the authors excluded trials that were marked by the data collectors as errors, or if other criteria were used within each trial.","The authors’ did not explicitly say why they chose to normalize the F0 values to semitone, and why they chose the 10th percentile as baseline as opposed to another. Other than that, their choice to normalize the other measurements to Z-score seems appropriate.","A lot of the analysis was very confusing, and it seemed at times overwhelming with so many visualizations, acoustic variables and running the model on all three focus conditions.

The presentation of the data generally only included statistically significant effects, but it would be helpful to include all the effects in order to evaluate which harmonics were significant and which were not. 

It was hard to draw conclusions from the data. It seemed like most everything was statistically significant, and the directions of the effects were not clearly stated. The authors do try to tie the results back to theory, but this could be strengthened, perhaps in motivating the choices earlier and understanding the ways that speech does (and doesn’t) change as a result of typicality.",1
genyonemus_evotis,96,70,70,publishable with major revision.,"Ratings were made on the basis of motivation from previous research, soundness of variable selection and coding, statistical analysis technique chosen, results, and interpretation of the model results.",The initial dimension reduction approach using t-SNE effectively demonstrates the correlation among the various metrics under consideration and is appropriate for an analysis without definite a priori direction. The use of a generalized linear model is also appropriate for the data (though see comments below regarding selection of independent variables).,"The researchers take a shotgun approach to analyzing acoustic features, selecting a smattering of potential correlates and seeing how those correlates cluster by condition. This initial approach to selecting variables (t-SNE) is acceptable given the researchers' lack of prior hypotheses, but the steps taken afterward are not.","The results of the feature analysis suggest that several of the acoustic metrics selected are highly correlated to one another, so it is inappropriate to add each as a main effect in a generalized linear model (due to multicollinearity and the concomitant decrease in precision in regression results).",The statistical model is inappropriately structured. The model is likely to overestimate the contribution of the predictors on the dependent variable and likely has inflated Type 1 error.  This is due to multicollinearity among the predictors and inadequate specification of the random effects structure (only including intercepts by subject).,"The authors made minimal exclusions for extreme outliers, but they did not exclude tokens that were tagged as errors (which may exert more influence on the model result than one or two extreme outliers, if the model is correctly specified).","I was curious why the authors did not use the output from the feature analysis as predictors for the regression analysis, given that the feature projections are by definition orthogonal to one another and capture similarity among the various acoustic measures.",N/A,1

chelonia_brummeri,80,90,85,publishable as is.,"These analyses were carefully thought through and competently carried out. One comment I have on the phonetic analyses is that the floor and ceiling for the F0 measures were set to a constant value. This sometimes results in pitch doubling or pitch halving for some talkers, so it might be good to check if any talkers seem to show drastic pitch discontinuities that can be corrected by changing these values. 

I thought the statistical analyses were reasonable and appropriate for the question. I do wonder whether there's a potential problem in redundancy between the syllable structure fixed term and the adjective random effect term, since there aren't many adjectives included to begin with; but I don't think this would invalidate the conclusions.",The analyses types are very appropriate for the questions. I don't have any concerns about the statistical analysis types themselves.,The process of choosing the variables for the models seems appropriate. Some decisions were not explicitly explained but they still seem like reasonable decisions overall. I have no concerns about this part of the analyses.,"The included variables are overall well suited to answer the question. I do think there might be some redundancy between some terms, such as the random effect of adjective and the fixed effect of syllable structure. Otherwise, both the dependent and independent variables seem reasonable.","The structures of the statistical models are very suitable to answer the question. I didn't have any concerns about this, although I am less familiar with the GAMMs than with the Bayesian linear mixed-effects models.",The decisions behind the exclusion of data were reasonable and appropriate.,"The transformations of the data were appropriate. One small worry is over whether the F0 values should be transformed to semitones. The transformation depends on the measure of a speaker's minimum F0, which might introduce problems given that estimation of pitch is not trivial and can sometimes introduce pitch-halving. In this case that could translate to it affecting all the pitch measurements for a speaker.","I am much less familiar with GAMMs than with Bayesian mixed effects models, and feel less confident about judging those. Still, the logic behind their inclusion seemed appropriate to me, and the execution resembled what I've seen in other studies analyzing similar types of data.",3
chelonia_brummeri,80,100,90,publishable with minor revision.,"I’d like a missing data analysis for the files not surviving MFA or Fast Track, and the heuristics used to flag implausible MFA boundary placement (e.g., implausibly short) or acoustic measurements (e.g., implausibly high/low formant estimations). I also am hesitant to analyze intensity in this dataset, even when values are relativised at the level of the utterance, but these methods are better than analyzing untransformed intensity. A minor note that did not impact my rating: using a F0 range from 0-600 for Praat F0 extraction and then, later, the default FastTrack settings seems incongruent to me - either you expect high pitch in the target or you don’t. 
",The Bayesian linear regression was appropriate for the analysis because it allowed for the maximal random effects structure. The priors were appropriate as well. It would be helpful to include a line about how the priors were appropriate based on prior predictive checks. I also appreciate how a detailed decision criteria was included for determining a reliable effect. My only critique is to provide reasoning for the .025 criteria when evaluating whether the CI overlaps with zero.,"The authors describe that the acoustic variables were chosen because they are suprasegmental features. They use relative intensity because the recording conditions are unknown. More detail could be provided for the choice of variables. 
","I appreciated that they included syllable structure as a fixed effect. Using a relative measure of intensity allowed its inclusion. The formant analysis was appropriate.
",he structure of the statistical model was appropriate.,Focusing on NF is appropriate.,"See above re: intensity - I also am hesitant to analyze intensity in this dataset, even when values are relativised at the level of the utterance, but these methods are better than analyzing untransformed intensity.

chelonia_brummeri,80,90,90,publishable as is.,The chosen variables were well-motivated and analyzed in a straightforward way.,The statistical methods were well-motivated and explained.,"The models chosen were appropriate and well-motivated for the research question. Considering F1 and F2 separately in this case fails to capture expected vowel space expansion as a whole; further, it limits the analysis to examining each vowel separately.","It would have been helpful to have more justification for the specific relative duration and intensity measures used in the analysis. Discussion of the interpretation of the raw F1 and F2 analysis would have improved the analysis. However, the inclusion of both prosodic and spectral variables was appropriate. The independent variables were also appropriate.",The Bayesian and GAMM analyses were well-motivated.,The researchers made appropriate choices to examine adjectives in noun focus conditions.,Data transformations were fine.,NA,3
chelonia_brummeri,79,77,82,publishable with minor revision.,"This team project chose proper dependent variables and statistics models to answer the research questions. They considered a few phonetic features, including duration, intensity, and f0. The statistic models are advanced, not only considering dependence in the data but also using the Bayesian method.","The use of the Bayesian linear mixed-effects model is great and proper to answer the research questions. Having by-participants and by-items random effects, the dependence problem in the data can be solved.  Bayesian methods make the results less dependent on p-values and give more confidence in the results.","In the operationalization section, they mentioned five dimensions that possibly typicality could influence. What they also could do is give more supporting literature and background information on why they looked at the five dimensions.","They considered three fixed effects: typicality, syllable structure of the stressed syllable in the adjective, trial number, and one interaction between trial and typicality. They did not mention the rationale for choosing trial and syllable structure as covariates.  Also, there is no supporting literature explaining why it is expected to have interaction between trial and typicality.","They kept the main predictor in all of the models and used the proper way of coding the predictor and the models had random effects and mixed effects. However, they did not mention what the maximum mixed model was, and how they reached the best model.","They only excluded trials indicating errors, which is proper to do so. Usually, trials with errors involve more cognitive cost and different cognitive routes. As long as being transparent with excluding data, it is acceptable.",They did not transform dependent and independent variables. What they could do is to check the regression diagnostics even for the Bayesian by plots and check whether they need to transform data. They could inverse or log duration.,They have done a great job! It would be great to see that they explain why they chose the informative priors.,2

lycodes_bradfieldi,90,35,65,publishable with major revision.,The full analysis write-up was not presented nor was the aggregate data used in the model made available. The team just presented a table with results.,"The authors choose to analyze the data with a RM ANOVA. The authors could have considered using analyses that do not aggregate across trials and assume that all trails are equal. Additionally, nonlinear model would are also an option (e.g., generalized additive models). 
","I have no issues with their choice of variables (they seem reasonable given the research question) and are supported by prior literature. 

The model itself, however, is fairly basic and does not take into account all sources of random variability which makes inferences biased. 
","Typicality and frequency band  are  suitable variables to include in the model. I would have probably included the frequency band variable as a continuous variable.

","The model does not account for all sources of variability (i.e., at the item and typicality levels).","They analyzed all the data. While there were not many
error trials I wonder if excluding them would have made a difference in  this analysis. 
","No transformations. It is not clear if the data met the assumptions for ANOVA (looks like they did not), and if not, what they did about it. 
","I found the document hard to follow. It would have been nice if they wrote up an actual results section as there is lots of data to follow. 

Aggregate data not included.

Regardless of “smallness” of effect size, the AM interaction was significant and should have been explored based on their answers in the questionnaire (significance will be determined by p < .05). 

Small was not defined by the authors nor which effect size they were using.

That means that data in condition NF was analyzed, but not condition AF or ANF, since typ_cat were not provided for trials in those conditions.","A Hilbert transform was applied, which seems appropriate.",NA,2
lycodes_bradfieldi,85,75,80,publishable with minor revision.,"The phonetic analysis is really promising. Yet, there could be some improvements, such as restricting the acoustic analysis to the relevant part, i.e. [(preposition + article +) adjective + noun (+ verb)], instead of taking the whole utterance including the carrier phrase. Focusing on the sequence of interest could improve the results, especially given that, apparently, the authors analyze mean AM and Mi. Besides, the analysis could have been explained more thoroughly. At some points it was not clear how the authors carried out the analysis and we had to turn to the references provided in the report.

The statistical analysis seems right, but we could not further evaluate it, since there was no easy way for us to reproduce it with the provided instructions (note also that we could not find a csv with the final data).","A repeated measures ANOVA analysis might be correct, given the categorical nature of the independent variables (typicality & and frequency band). Yet, the rationale for the analysis type of decision is not provided.",The rationale for selecting variables is explained in the questionnaire and seems right.,We deem the included variables appropriate.,"As far as we can tell, we have no major objections. The only caveat is that the process is not totally transparent and we could not reproduce it ourselves.",There is no mention of exclusions on the report and the criteria to include all the data given in the questionnaire is dubious: 1. Number of trials is already low. This should not be a criterion to accept bad utterances 2. Utterances are instructions and thus there is no clear exclusion criteria. This might be problematic to some extent. Many of the utterances had already been labeled with error or hesitation break and our team found some more errors and hesitation breaks and this should already constitute an exclusion criterion. It might be even more problematic if the errors happened in the atypical or medium typicality values (we did not check or test that).,"According to the questionnaire (Q7), there were no transformations. This does not seem correct. Mi seems to be a kind of transformation of AM, including a min-max normalization of the pre-final result.","The statistical analysis felt a bit obscure. There was no additional data or measurement file. Given that the whole analysis but the final ANOVAs was carried out on MATLAB proprietary software and that we could not find any csv file with the results of the acoustical analysis, we were prevented from actually evaluating the process and results ourselves. Replicability is compromised.

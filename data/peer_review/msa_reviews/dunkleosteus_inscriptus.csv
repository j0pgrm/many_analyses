dunkleosteus_inscriptus,80,70,90,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis is done with an R script that is available on OSF and contains helpful comments throughout the script. The authors chose Linear Mixed-Effects models with NHST and Bayesian Mixed-Effects models with ROPE analysis for analysing the data. 

Being unfamiliar to Bayesian Mixed Effects modelling and especially to the given ROPE plots in the paper, we cannot comment on the usefulness of these analyses","As we are not familiar with the Bayesian Mixed Effects models we cannot say if the choice of these models is a good one for the given data, however, the Linear Mixed-Effects Models are a valid choice for working with duration data.","We will, again, comment on the Linear Mixed-Effects Models only:

Separate models for focus condition and typicality were fitted to answer the research question “Does the acoustic profile of an utterance with an atypical referent like blue banana differ from one with a typical referent such as yellow banana in German utterances containing focused noun phrases?”.  Since the models are run separately, we are dealing with a relatively simple fixed effect structure: condition (first model) vs. typicality (second and following models). The authors opted for random intercepts instead of random slopes. We think that this is a valid choice.","The authors ran several Linear Mixed-Effect Models. The focus condition model is used to validate the duration measurements since the authors assume an effect for focused elements of an utterance. The authors opted for the measurement of relative noun/adjective durations instead of absolute durations as a dependent variable and find an effect, namely that nouns are longer in focused condition. Their explanation for this choice is valid and comprehensible.  

However, for the typicality models the authors seem to have changed the modelling approach and decided to test relative AND absolute noun durations. As the authors say themselves “absolute durations are influenced by speech rate, number of syllables in the noun length, number of syllables in the adjective and other factors”. Since these factors might influence the results and are not included as covariates, it is questionable if we can trust the results of the absolute duration models. Unfortunately from the report it is not clear to us what the results of the absolute and what the results of the relative duration models are and if there was any difference between these two.","For the Linear Mixed-Effects models the structure seemed to be suitable with an exception for the absolute duration typicality models that would need more explanation and a clear report of the results, since they go somewhat against what the authors said themselves about the suitability of absolute durations for the analysis in the focus condition model (see above).","Based on the research question, typicality is only relevant for focused nouns and the authors built a subset (Condition: NF) to run their models on. However, they say later that modelling was then done on the subset AND on the full data set. Why was the modelling done on the full data set if only the focused noun condition is relevant for the RQ? Which of the models correspond to the full data set and what is the result compared to the subset? This remains unclear in the report and needs to be answered in the text.","The authors opted for relative durations to avoid problems related to possible effects of other factors on absolute duration. This is a valid choice to us, however, see above for comments on absolute durations (since the authors also included them in another set of models that would need a more detailed explanation in the report as to why this was done and what the results were).","While most scripts, data, and codes seem to be available on OSF and is well described in the text, the only thing that seems to be missing is  the output of the BAS pipeline, the <XX i.pipeline.TextGrid> files that are mentioned in the text. These output files are fed into a second Matlab function, that is also present in the OSF project and well explained, which then calculates the durations for the given output files and saves it to spreadsheets. The spreadsheets are saved in the OSF project. Since both functions are given and the second one needs the <XX i.pipeline.TextGrid> files as input, the authors might want to add the files to the OSF project for reproducability.

dunkleosteus_inscriptus,60,55,57,publishable with major revision.,"Positives:
- Identified f0, intensity and duration as relevant measures (although only duration was analyzed)
- Excluded error trials and validated using a force aligner
- Motivated measuring syllable rate
- Considered using a relative duration measure to account for overall speaking rate

Negatives:
- Several issues with the structure of the models (see comments below)
- Unclear why f0 and intensity could not be measured in an automatic and replicable way
- Included data from all focus conditions when testing for typicality without acknowledging the unbalanced design, and maintaining the typicality condition as “NA” for data from the AF and ANF conditions
- Did not report effect sizes in the report. Unclear how to interpret the effect sizes reported in the survey
- Unclear criteria for data validation and exclusions (see comments below)
","Mixed effects models are an appropriate analysis type. It would have been useful to include an explanation for why both mixed effects models with NHST and equivalent Bayesian models were used, as well as more explanation for how to interpret the ROPE analysis. 
","1. The team described having measured the number of syllables in the noun and adjective, but it is unclear whether this was used in the statistical analyses. Controlling for number of syllables is a good idea, but it doesn’t look like this was used to calculate relative duration of noun and adjective (the main DV) or included in the models as a fixed or random effect.
2. Similarly, the team identified speech rate as a potentially relevant factor to control for, but did not include speech rate as a covariate in the models. 
3. The team performed different models to test for the effects of focus condition, and typicality. However, the models on typicality included data from all focus conditions (including conditions where typicality was coded as “NA” - more on this later). We disagree with this choice: if data from all focus conditions is being analyzed in a single model, then it is critical that the model include both typicality and focus condition as fixed effects, as well as their interaction.
4. We disagree with the team’s claim that there are considerable methodological difficulties with measuring f0 and intensity (two very relevant acoustic measures associated with focus) or that it could not have been done through automatic methods. While it is true that f0 cannot be tracked over voiceless intervals (e.g., consonants), this can easily be circumvented by averaging f0 over voiced segments (vowels) for each word, as has been done in previous research (e.g., Lam & Watson, 2010), without the need to use ToBI annotations. Secondly, as the design was entirely within-subject and many relevant factors (speaker, target noun etc) can be controlled for in the mixed effects models as random effects, there are no methodological issues with measuring intensity.
5. It was unclear why the team performed all of the duration measurements indicated in Table 1 (e.g., including the whole utterance, the matrix clause etc) when only a subset of them were used in the analyses.
","1. We don’t agree with the choice to analyze data from all focus conditions when testing for the effect of typicality. That is because the AF and ANF conditions were not designed to be balanced across typicality levels and included non-fruit target nouns (filler items). Thus, the only focus condition that includes color-noun combinations across all 3 typicality levels is the NF condition. If the team wanted to include data from the other focus conditions, they could have done so by (1) including focus condition as a predictor, (2) coding the typicality factor as either typical, medium or atypical based on the typicality norming data, instead of leaving it as NA, and (3) acknowledged that the resulting model would still be imperfect due to the unbalanced nature of the design.
2. A further issue with including data from the AF and ANF conditions in the typicality models, coded as NA for typicality, is that it leads to a very unbalanced dataset (~250 trials x typicality conditions in NF, versus ~900 trials coded as NA across AF and ANF). 
3. The coding scheme for the mixed effects models was not specified. We would assume that the team used the default R treatment coding with Atypical as the baseline (as Atypical does not appear in the model outputs); we would suggest to specify and justify the coding scheme, and perhaps use Typical or Medium as the baseline.
","Other than the issues described above, we would also recommend including by-Participant random slopes for Typicality in the initial random effects structure, and then simplify it in case of convergence issues (Barr et al., 2013).
","1. The criteria for data validation were not well defined and justified. Why did the team use both -2SD and +3SD as outlier cutoffs? (Why not just +/- 2SD or 3SD?) How exactly did the team determine if these cutoffs were “too aggressive”, and in which distributions did they adjust them?
2. We suggest that the team could have used a different force aligner (e.g., Montreal Forced Aligner, MFA; McAuliffe et al., 2017) leading to fewer errors. It was unclear how exactly the team determined which trials should be excluded from the analysis based on force aligner error, and which should not (as they note in the Discussion that erroneous data remained even after data validation and cleaning).
","The team could have provided better motivation for why it was necessary to use relative duration as the main DV. Similarly, it was unclear why the team conducted the same analysis on both relative and absolute duration.

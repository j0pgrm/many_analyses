ctenosaura_limax,100,100,95,publishable as is.,The way the analysis was done is well explained and replicable with the provided ressources,Multinominal logistic regression is definitely a suitable model for the research questions.,"Three groups of models were used, the first used a subset of features, the second all extracted features and the last was a random baseline. Why and how the specific features were chosen for model 1 is kept rather vage, and it is not explained why these variables are more interpretable than others though I do agree that the variables are well-known and that these three groups of models make a lot of sense for being able to interpret the results.","The variables chosen for model version 1 are well-known and well-studied features in prosody, so they are suitable to investigate the research question. However, the reason for excluding the other variables is not well-explained. Especially how the original 20 features from the list 88 features is not explained. This likely will not alter the results, so I did not deduct any point for this, I just personally would have found it interesting. Especially with regards to the variables that are highly correlated, I would have found it interesting 1) which variables those are and 2) which variables were excluded based on this criterion and why these specific variables were excluded.","For the research question, I find the three models well-suited.","The analysis did not exclude any tokens from the critical condition, i.e., incorrectly produced sentences were included in the analysis. I personally would have excluded incorrectly produced sentences, however, since there were not a lot of them in the data set, it likely does not make a large difference not to exclude them.","I have not used the tools myself but based on the explanations in the report, the transformations seem fine to me.","It is hard for me to evaluate this analysis since I have not personally used most of the tools, e.g., the openSMILE tool, and models described. Because of this, I cannot really judge how accurate the results are, only that I find the choice of methods well-explained.",3
ctenosaura_limax,80,70,75,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis was overall convincing, and the statistical model used was satisfactory, however, there were some issues of replicability. The description of the analysis and the scripts lacked details and could have benefitted from more clarification.","The authors chose to use a multinomial logistic regression model which seems appropriate for predicting multiclass models such as the current one with three possible discrete outcomes (atypical, medium, and typical).","A subset of the full 88 features was selected based on their relation to voice source, but the full features were also kept for a separate model to provide a source of comparison which appears to be a good idea. Because multinomial logistic regression assumes that collinearity is relatively low between variables, it seems wise that the authors inspected the variables through a correlation matrix and chose to keep only 10 features in the models. 
Even if a reference is cited for further detail on the measures that were used, it might be beneficial to at least have a full list of measures obtained in the paper itself.","The 10 variables that ended up being included seems to be highly suitable for the analysis as they are deemed more interpretable and familiar to the linguistics community. 
The choice to exclude MFCCs as variables in the main model because they are less easily interpretable is debatable. Solid interpretations can also be drawn from MFCCs.  
Variables were suitable but only the most important one (mean F1 relative energy) was discussed in the results, there was no interpretation drawn from other variables which may also have contributed to the classification. It would be interesting to see if other variables had the same or different weights across the 30 iterations of the model. It would be helpful to show the inspection of the results within the script. 
",Cross-validation to prevent overfitting the model so each model group has 30 trained models for each speaker. Structure is satisfactory but the correlation matrix should have been included.,"The authors chose to focus specifically on the noun focus condition of the provided data, which is a satisfactory choice but was not justified in the paper.","Multiple transformations (mean, variance etc.) but in the end, the variables that were chosen were based on their non-correlation and ease of interpretation.","The scripts could benefit from more annotations and visualization. They lack the required package information, for example. We weren’t able to run the code for forced alignment or for the measures obtained with OpenSMILE – in other words only the statistical analysis itself was replicable. 
Furthermore, the stats script is lacking details as well, it would be helpful if it were annotated. It’s hard to understand was “pos_variables” and “neg_variables” are and they are not explained in the paper. The correlation matrix is not included and the multinomial model did not converge, so there is a potential interpretation problem.

ctenosaura_limax,66,66,22,publishable with major revision.,"'Ctenosaura_limax' used 10 acoustic features from the openSMILE toolkit that represent a diverse (and somewhat arbitrary) set of features. These 10 features vary in their consistency with respect to articulation or perception of speech and they are disconnected from linguistic structure beyond the noun phrase. We address the suitability of these measurements in more detail below.

'Ctenosaura_limax' used multinomial logistic regression models for statistical analysis. We are not familiar with the methods used, and it was challenging to understand the description of the descriptions of the statistical analysis method. Then the information in ctenosaura_limax.txt helped us to better understand the statistical analysis. As far as we could tell, there were no significant errors. Our rating for the statistical analysis reflects that it took significant effort to make sense of the relevant part of the report. 


The overall rating reflects our concerns about how to link the research question, data analysis, and interpretations. The choice to measure the whole noun phrase has unfortunate implications. This problem affects all the acoustic variables as it appears to blur distinctions across the board at two levels of analysis: (1) ignoring the distinction between the two words of the noun phrase — the adjective and the noun; and (2) ignoring the distinction between syllables within words, namely the stressed and the final syllables that tend to carry most of the prosodic weight in distinct ways. This decision essentially prevents the possibility to interpret any of the findings in terms of actual acoustic events. We believe that this interpretability problem at the heart of this study greatly undermines an otherwise worthy effort by 'ctenosaura_limax’.


'Ctenosaura_limax’ stated that “[w]e initially fitted models with 88 acoustic features that were commonly used for machine learning in speech. However, we found that many variables were not linguistically interpretable (MFCCs), even though they were highly predictive. So we later decided to select a subset of 10 f0 and formant features that were more familiar to linguists as the variables for regression analysis.” In our view, the linguistic relevance of the subset of the formant features is not clear.  

","We are not experienced in the techniques in the present analysis. The descriptions of the analysis procedure in the report were too technical. As stated above, the teams’ response to the questionnaire (ctenosaura_limax.txt) helped us to understand the procedure, and there seemed to be no significant errors.","'Ctenosaura_limax' used the openSMILE toolkit to extract 88 acoustic features. They ignore 68 features unrelated to voice sources, and they eliminate 10 out of the remaining 20 to improve ""model interpretability"". The authors claim that they eliminated features based on them being highly correlated, but they do not mention the criterion for choosing which one should remain. The remaining 10 features represent a mixed bag of very straightforward (e.g. F0) and more complex (e.g. the ratio of energy in the first harmonic and the energy of the highest harmonic in the third formant) measurements.

The main concerns regarding these measurements are with what 'ctenosaura_limax' refer to as ""high-level features"": the calculation of means and standard deviations over the entire adjective-noun phrase, without the ability to link any of the measurements to elements in the linguistic structure analyzed.
","'Ctenosaura_limax' used the openSMILE toolkit to extract 10 acoustic features. These include some very basic measures, like F0 that simply refers to pitch, and some more complex measures that refer to aspects of voice quality, such as the ratio between energy in the first and second harmonics (H1-H2). All measurements were calculated as the mean and standard deviation over the entire adjective-noun phrase. The standard deviation was not calculated for the two F0 slope measurements, which are presented as ""meanRisingSlope"" and ""meanFallingSlope"". We could not find an explanation (including external sources from openSMILE) as to what this slope measurement in fact reflects (does it select the min and max F0 points for the whole phrase? that would inevitably capture many unrelated F0 trajectories). The interpretation of the voice quality features is also lacking here. What is the perceptual effect that is associated with the ratio between the energy of the first 3 formants and the energy of F0? The latter is the most predictive feature in the model and we do not understand what is the articulatory or perceptual effect that it is assumed to cover (this could be our own ignorance, of course, but the authors should have made this clearer).

Note also that voice quality measures (6 out of 10 in this study), that are very sensitive to physiological differences between different speakers, are also quite reflective of differences in the segmental makeup (e.g. voiceless vs. vocalic material, different vowel qualities), such that they may be quite problematic in the context of this data set which is not lexically balanced by design.

","The structure seemed to be suitable, but we are not entirely confident about our judgment. 
","'Ctenosaura_limax' analyzed only NF tokens. This choice is justifiable given that we were interested in the ‘typicality’ as a predictor within the NF condition. That said, they did not exclude the tokens flagged as errors of various types in the original data, which would have been a justifiable move (although probably not very consequential). We also point out that ‘ctenosaura_limax’ has only provided acoustical analyses for the Noun Phrase, excluding the utterance portions before and after the NP, in case this can be construed as an example of subsetting the data.",Mean-variance normalization (z-scores) was applied. The transformation seemed appropriate.,NA,1
ctenosaura_limax,90,95,90,publishable with minor revision.,"This overall a very good and compelling analysis. However, most of the justifications for the several decisions taken here appear somewhere else (Eyben, 2015), which leaves the reviewer with two choices: either trust the authors or go consult Eyben. For the sake of time, I did something in the middle, that is, I read the overall rationale and premise of Eyben's work. In any case, I wish authors had included a bit more information in their own report, especially for the acoustic analysis.","The statistical analysis is better explained than the acoustic one. The stats seem appropriate, especially in terms of narrowing down the analysis to variables that are interpretable, rather than pursuing the analysis until the end with all 88 features.","Very good, though, as I said before, I wish authors had elaborated a bit more on their decisions rather than referring the reader to other sources.",Appropriate.,Appropriate,There is no mention of excluding trials identified as containing errors. This would be the main reason why I did not give this analysis a higher score.,Good,NA,2

psittacula_scabriculus,50,50,50,publishable with major revision.,"We have a few major concerns with both the phonetic and statistical analysis presented here. On the phonetic side, the main issues are with the fact that the vowels were hand-measured, and given that the analysis relies on precise measurements of duration. The authors should’ve used one of the many available forced aligners to have a consistent method for measuring duration. Additionally, the fact that they took an average of all vowels in each word does not account for the fact that the data included tokens of varying syllable length, which could impact their results (and no hypothesis was given to justify this measure of length effects). Finally, they did not differentiate between stressed and unstressed vowels, which naturally have different durations and could significantly impact their results, given the aforementioned differences in number of syllables between target words. 
","On the statistical side, see below for more details, but the chief concern is that vowel duration should have been normalized in some way, and they should have accounted for vowel stress. The model is simple and straightforward and is logical given the data structure, but it does not include all necessary variables, and is based on flawed data.","The process for choosing the variable of vowel duration seemed appropriate. One limitation is that the team used default priors from bmrs, which may be suitable but they should’ve motivated this choice and also discussed it as a possible limitation.","While the choice of duration is appropriate, it does seem that the values of the variables should have differed, however, in at least two ways. Vowel duration should be normalized (to control for effects of variable speech rate). Also, the vowel duration should not have been an average, for one of at least two reasons. As a first possibility: If the stressed vowel is changing in duration differently than other vowels (e.g., possibly as the only vowel changing in duration), then using an average of all vowels will lead to different effect sizes in words with different numbers of syllables (because the effect of change in a stressed vowel will be less in a 4 syllable word than in a 2 syllable word). As a second possibility: since stressed and unstressed vowels naturally have different durations, differential proportions of stressed-to-unstressed vowels could significantly impact their results.","The model structure is suitable, and we appreciate the authors’ attempts to use Bayesian models.","The only data excluded was from speech errors (as determined by the researchers) and vowels that they claim were “unrealized”. This is fine, but more detail about what counted as “unrealized” would have been helpful.","The vowel durations should have been normalized, so as to make comparisons across individuals / contexts (because of what’s known about speech rate variability).","As a minor detail: the .xlsx file is included, but not the .csv file that the .Rmd alludes to.

As a more important detail: the .docx writeup alludes to the mean vowel duration for the atypicality condition as either .08 (in table 1) or as .09 (in the prose). After running the included R file, it seems the prose is correct.

Finally, because there were the earlier-mentioned methodological problems, and because the results go in the opposite direction of expectation (no hypothesis we can think of would expect medium typicality to have the shortest duration; the null hypothesis should be atypical > medium > typical), the model (and especially the data-prep for the model) ought to be given much more scrutiny (in ways described above).

psittacula_scabriculus,78,78,78,publishable with minor revision.,"This analysis is concise and contain most information that is needed. The main issues I have with the analysis are: (1) Data exclusion. ""Trials containing longer pauses were not excluded "" -- why? It is unclear what 'longer pauses' refers to and how they would affect the vowel duration. It could benefit from having a sentence or two to explain the criterion. (2) Bayesian analysis. While I know the Bayesian analysis method, I cannot say I am an expert in it. I think this is the status for most people in the field since the traditional lmers are still the mainstream way. It is therefore needed, at this point of time in history, to explain more to the readers how the models are configured. It is true that all the parameters were reported, but without reading a book on Bayesian statistical analysis, I, as a reader, cannot gauge well whether the parameters were set in the optimal way. This is especially the case with the priors, which I think is quite important in the analysis. (3) Uploaded data file. The data file uploaded to the OSF does not match with what was used in the script. Fortunately, it seems to contain the correct data.","Good choice, but needs more explanation.",Reasonable,Suitable.,Suitable.,"As mentioned above, more explanations are needed for why 'trials containing longer pauses were not excluded'.",NA,NA,2
psittacula_scabriculus,90,80,86,publishable with minor revision.,"The analyses are done very similarly to what I would have done, the variables chosen are well justified, the reporting of the results is a bit confusing though (this might be just the wording though, not necessarily the method).","I have not personally worked with the method, but based on my research, the method is suitable for an analysis of the type done in the report.","The choices were made based on previous literature, so that seems fine","average vowel duration is technically a good variable, however, I am not sure how well it works as an insular variable, especially because all the targets have different vowels in different phonetic contexts.",seems fine,"quite a number of trials were excluded based on either production errors or because the vowel was not articulated. These are good criteria, however, the report did not specify which trials were excluded and if this lead to unbalanced numbers for e.g., the different typicality conditions or the represented vowels.",If feel like the fact that the targets had different vowels in different contexts should have been addressed somewhere.,NA,2
psittacula_scabriculus,90,72,75,publishable with minor revision.,"Overall strong analysis with a few errors in the statistical analysis (especially in the random effects & prior specifications) – however, these do not affect the outcomes too much.",The statistical model (Bayesian mixed effects model) is entirely appropriate for this analysis.,"The process of choosing variables was transparent and clearly described. The authors opted to look at average vowel durations within word tokens, which is OK, though my impression is that the literature has more examples of work on word durations. One advantage of using average vowel durations in this scenario is that while word durations will vary widely across nouns simply as a function of the segments they contain, the average vowel durations are more stable. The main predictor variable is typicality with all three-levels included, which is a straightforward and appropriate choice.",They are well-suited to the analysis & the research questions.,"There are two issues with the statistical model:
(1) The model includes a random slope over typicality by item, but the nouns *did not vary* across the typicality conditions – each of them only occurs in one typicality condition. Therefore, this random slope cannot be estimated from the data. I've checked what happens when it is included, and the results are essentially the same, so in the end this does not make much of a difference – nonetheless, this is an error in the model specification.
(2) The authors suggest that they chose a weakly informative prior, but (as far as I understand) the scale of the prior here is not really congruent with the scale on which vowel durations vary. That is, the authors went for a prior of N(0,1) for the typicality effect, but the vowel durations vary within a much narrower range (0.036 s to 0.44 s); so a more appropriate distribution might have an SD of, say, 0.1 (which would still easily allow differences of 0.2-0.3 s among the groups, even though such large differences in vowel duration are still not really expected).","There were some exclusions based on the original annotations & observed vowel deletions in the data. These all seem perfectly justified, and, given the negative results, there's really no indication of data dredging.","Perhaps the only transformation to mention is the averaging of vowel durations within tokens. It would have been possible to fit the data to the raw vowel durations (and perhaps include phoneme identity as random effect!), but I doubt it would have changed much.",Overall impressive analysis!,2

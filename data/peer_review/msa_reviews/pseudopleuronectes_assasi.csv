pseudopleuronectes_assasi,95,85,90,publishable with minor revision.,"We discussed a score of 90 for the statistical analysis itself, but reduced it to 85 because the presentation of the analysis techniques and results was not all that easy to follow in places, and would have been greatly enhanced by use of some plots (e.g. to illustrate the arguments about normality).","The choice of test is appropriate (lmer) and the approach is reasonable i.e. comparison (using likelihood ratio tests) of a null model (with random effects only) to a model which includes the fixed factor of interest as well as random effects. A limitation of the choice to use lmer is that the data did not allow inclusion of random slopes, but only random intercepts for speakers/items.",The report provides a good amount of information about the rationale for the choice of variables and for the structure of the models.,The DVs (duration/F0/intensity/F1~F2) are appropriate choices for investigation of acoustic cues to prominence in German.,"The appropriate fixed factors were investigated (focus condition in Study 1; typicality in Study 2); it made sense to include sex as an additional fixed factor only for F0. They clearly acknowledge that the inability to include random slopes is a limitation of the analysis, and interpret the results with caution.","They identified appropriate subsets of the data to work in in which it was safe to compare within/across conditions (e.g. avoiding comparisons where nouns differ across conditions). 

The Study 1 analysis serves to show that there is meaningful variation in the chosen DVs in response to the condition focus (i.e. in the expected direction, except for F1~F2). Study 2 addresses the main RQ regarding typicality and yields a null result. One could argue that the null result cannot simply be set aside as a result of e.g. task failure, due to the observed effects of focus on the same DVs in Study 1 (the authors don’t make this argument but are appropriately cautious and just reject the hypothesis).","We did not quite grasp the arguments put forward about the lack of normality in the distribution of the DVs, and it was complicated by mixed results from normality tests. Some plots of the data might have helped clarify this argument. An alternative approach to normalisation (e.g. to a relevant local domain/baseline measure for each speaker and/or token) might avoid this issue and allow easier interpretation of the data.","For reproducibility, we would recommend saving an annotated R script instead of the R console history. In general, the argumentation in the results would have been enhanced by provision of descriptive statistics (e.g. plots) as well as the results of the statistical models.",2
pseudopleuronectes_assasi,80,75,77,publishable with minor revision.,"Overall this was an appropriate analysis to address the experimental question, and most of the decisions are clearly explained. There are some decisions as to phonetic measurements and statistical analyses that I have small concerns about. For example, about the necessity to include sex as a fixed effect if one can already include subject as a random effect.","The choice to use multi-level models and model comparison via ANOVA is appropriate. While not the most cutting-edge analyses, they follow the standards of many of our fields. Some common issues with these methods arose for these analyses, such as convergence issues, but the decisions made to cope with that seem reasonable and I doubt they would change the overall conclusions.",I appreciated the clarity with which the authors presented their hypotheses and justification for their models. I think overall the models are well-justified and -reasoned.,"The dependent and independent variables make sense, although I have doubts about including Sex as a fixed effect in models that already include Speaker as a random intercept.","The structure of the statistical models are reasonable. Given that these were multi-level models, there were some compromises that had to be made for the models to converge. This is to be expected, but the choices they made to aid convergence were standard and I do not believe they impact the conclusions.","Data exclusion criteria are clearly explained and well-justified. I do wonder whether it's necessary to exclude everything but the NF condition for some of the typicality analyses. I think it's reasonable to do this given the experimental design, though.","I was initially concerned about the conversion of F0 from Hz to semitones. It seems like it might introduce room for error, but the fact that the baseline was a constant number rather than a measured value, and that the experimenters found the same overall pattern when looking at Hz addresses my concerns.

I did notice that Duration was not log transformed, which is a fairly standard transformation to perform. I think there is good reason to log transform Duration values for these types of analyses, although I expect the patterns will remain the same.",I appreciate the quality of the writing of this write-up. Presenting relevant background literature and the thought process leading to the analyses provided me with good information when evaluating the analyses.,2
pseudopleuronectes_assasi,75,70,70,publishable with major revision.,"Phonetic (85) - They show one case of boundary placement but demonstrating reliability quantitatively through ICCs would be beneficial. 
They have some heuristics to flag implausible values, but need to describe how many tokens this impacted and justify why they did not manually remeasure the flagged tokens and a subset of the non-flagged tokens for reliability. Also how were these excluded tokens distributed across speakers and conditions?
Praat formant extract is known to be sensitive to speaker characteristics and the details at how LPC settings were customized for each speaker were omitted from the paper. A tool like Fast Track might have helped here, at least for determining speaker-specific Max Formant settings if not for extracting the formants in full. 
Why not exclude the liquid from the segmentation of the vowel, and take measurements throughout the vowel? 
How did they handle the cases of pitch-halving that were not handled by changing the F0 floor to 100 for female speakers?
I remain unconvinced that intensity could be meaningfully measured given the lack of precise experimental control for the purpose of measuring intensity.

There appears to be poor inter-rater reliability for start and end points of stressed vowels, despite the detailed guidelines for annotating the utterances. It was unclear whether the annotation in Figure 2 was prior to adopting these guidelines or after adopting these guidelines, or whether there was any method for determining inter-rater reliability (i.e., by comparing 10% of the segmentations across all segmenters). 

Formant Distance measure: I have some reservations about determining F1 and F2 averages across all vowels in this case, as it appears that the authors include syllable-final r and l within the vowel segments. This decision may have influenced the formant measures across all vowels. In addition, did the authors investigate whether one vowel may have been overrepresented in the corpus before using a mean measure of F1 and F2 as the basis for determining formant distance.

How many formants had a z-score of greater than 2 and were therefore automatically eliminated? 
","The model formulation was appropriate, especially with the inclusion of random effects by speaker and item. Comparison to the null was appropriate but unusual. I would have liked to have seen F or T scores reported from the models. Also normality of the raw data was not important for the regression analysis, but rather normality of the residuals. 
","The choice of acoustic variables to be evaluated was well-motivated by previous literature on German stress. The decision to compare AF and NF nouns does not answer the research question, as it only relates to the atypical condition, and there are likely not enough tokens of the AF measures included for this analysis. Excluding the AF measures may have resolved the reported difficulties in the analysis. Overall, the statistical models in 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 do not appear to be appropriate to answer the research question.
For 4.2.3 [for the f0 dependent variable], it is unclear why the authors chose to divide the group by sex, in addition to using participant as a random intercept. It seems more likely that this would be an individual difference than a sex-based difference. 
Please note that the measurements taken of the acoustic variables, however, are not optimal (see above).
","For the F0 analysis in the NF condition, there was no need to analyze by sex, as this difference would be captured by individual effects.
For the analyses in 4.2.1 and 4.2.2, the inclusion of AF tokens was not suitable, as it allowed only for the comparison of atypical tokens and did not contribute to answering the research question.
",The basic statistical model for 4.2.3 appears to be appropriate (with the exception of investigating sex effects for the F0 dependent variable).,I would have liked more information about the individual tokens that were excluded due to Praat formant tracking difficulties.,"The use of Euclidean distance for the vowel dispersion measure was fine, although I have reservations about including coda /l, r/ in the calculation of the “mean” vowel and questions about the frequency of different vowels appearing in this calculation.

pseudopleuronectes_assasi,80,71,76,publishable with minor revision.,"The phonetic analyses seemed to examine relevant variables for exploring a hypothesis about prosodic manipulation. 

We're not sure why the AF-NF comparison is relevant to the hypotheses and would have liked more explanation about the inclusion of this analysis. 

The authors don't clearly specify the models used (e.g., lmer and ANOVA vs Chi-squared).",The type of statistical analysis appears appropriate to answer the research question using the variables specified. The approach of comparison between a null model and a model with a single fixed effect seems non-standard; we're not sure how to interpret a linear mixed-effects model with no fixed effect.,"The variables are appropriate to answer the research question using prosodic hypotheses. We're unsure about the approach of comparing a null model to a model with one fixed effect. 
","It's unclear why the NF-AF condition comparison was relevant to the research question. The rest of the variables included the other models in the analysis are appropriate.

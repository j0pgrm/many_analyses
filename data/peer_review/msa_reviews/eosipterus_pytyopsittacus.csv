eosipterus_pytyopsittacus,55,30,20,publishable with major revision.,"I'd like to preface this by saying that overall, the analysis looks competently done, and clearly a lot of work has gone into it. I gave low ratings for the following reasons: (i) no scripts or other materials were shared, which compromises the replicability of the analysis; (ii) many analysis details are not reported transparently, and may only be replicable to those who are intimately familiar with the methods employed by the authors (and perhaps not even by those, given the lack of details); (iii) the project does not answer the MSA research question, which is clearly highlighted on the website, i.e. ""Your task will be to investigate whether typicality affects the phonetics of the utterances."". I gave the phonetic analysis a higher rating mainly to reflect the fact that what was done seems to be competently carried out, though it is very difficult to evaluate given the lack of details / scripts. I gave the statistical analysis a lower rating since – while clustering and random forests are great exploratory techniques – it did not address the main research question in any form. The overall score is the lowest as this project does not speak to the research question in any substantive way.","K-means clustering and random forests are great exploratory techniques, but they are not suitable for hypothesis testing. Although the research question here could probably be couched in exploratory terms, these techniques do not produce the kind of estimates (e.g. effect sizes, confidence intervals, etc.) that can easily be compared across analyses.","This process seemed largely appropriate, though it's not clear to me why the random forest was refitted with a smaller set of variables – isn't it clear from the full model that certain variables contribute less to the results than others?",The variables seem appropriate for (i) clustering accent types and (ii) predicting focus type – but not for answering the main research question.,"Both the K-means clustering and random forest models look OK, though, importantly, the models ignore dependencies within speakers and items, which is an issue here.",The exclusions reported in the survey responses seem reasonable & theoretically motivated.,"There were various derived measures that went into the models fitted by the authors, but there was not transformation per se. The calculation of these derived measures seemed fine, though it was hard to evaluate this process given the lack of details.",NA,1
eosipterus_pytyopsittacus,75,60,68,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis done looks fine enough to me, however, I really don't understand how the analysis answers the research question, so I gave it a bit of a lower score. The analysis, especially the statistical model, seem to answer the question whether f0 contours are different depending on the focus condition and not whether typicality is marked using prosody. 
I do think that the analysis is done well overall, I just had a very hard time judging it against the background of the project. If I had only scored based on the suitability for answering the research question, I would have given a much lower score.","The model seemed to work well for the question the researchers investigated (i.e., prediction of the focus condition). I would have been interested to see if this model could also be used to predict the typicality condition.","Since the variables (f0 slope; f0 height and duration) were based on the PoLaR annotation I am not familiar with, it is difficult to judge the accuracy of these annotations. However, I could not find any specification of which durations or f0 values were measured, only the rather vague ""all analysis [was limited"" to the parts of each utterance containing the determiner, adjective and noun"", so it is unclear to me how exactly the values for the variables were optained. It is also not clear to me if the PoLaR method includes acoustic measurements or if it is based on relative (and more subjective) categorization like in the ToBI system.","Duration, f0 height and f0 slope are adequate variables to judge prosody. The choice of the focus condition as the main variable is great to answer the research question posed in the report, but not to answer the research question posed by the project.",seems good to me,"only the medium typical condition from all focus conditions was included. As previously said, I don't think it is possible to answer the research question posed by the project with this subset of the data. If I only take the research question posed by the researchers themselves into account, then I am unsure why no control condition was chosen. It would have been possible to compare medium typical and typical combinations in the different focus conditions.
Furthermore, no data was excluded based on errors or hesitation etc. Since one of the variables was f0 slope, I figure that a hesitation break would have an effect. There is however no explanation as to why these trials were not excluded.",-,-,2
eosipterus_pytyopsittacus,10,10,10,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"The main problem of the proposed analysis is that it is out of the scope of the current project. The authors did not look at typicality but only at whether the noun, adjective or both were in focus (and worked only with medium typical utterances). This cannot contribute to answering the research question of the project, which was “Do speakers phonetically modulate utterances to signal atypical word combinations?”, as stated on the website.
Additionally, the report is not always clear. Some abbreviations are not explained (e.g., “ML”, p. 1), some procedures are only rapidly mentioned but not described or justified (e.g., extracting procedures for the k-means analysis), and some variables are not adequately described (acoustic measures included in the model).
Importantly, this analysis lacks reproducibility. Textgrids are not provided, even though a large amount of at least partially manual work was done to annotate them according to the PoLaR conventions. The whole PoLAR analysis is not reproducible at all. R scripts are not provided either, and the specifications of the random forests models are not provided.","The authors used a random forests classification model. The choice of the analysis is not justified, but seems appropriate with respect to what the authors are investigating.","The first step of the analysis was a k-means clustering analysis on three acoustic measures based on PoLaR labels: “the length of time coded as accent-related”, “the average scaled f0 height”, and “a measure taking into account the slopes of the f0 movement during the pitch accent”. 

The authors used the results of the k-means clustering as predictors in a random forest classification model trying to predict whether the noun, adjective or both were informationally focused. They also added some acoustic variables as additional predictors.

Running the k-means analysis first to use the results as predictors in the random forest classification analysis is standard and makes sense. However, the choice of the measures used as input to the k-means structuring is not really justified or explained. The authors just mentioned that they used PoLaR-BEAR to guide their analysis of the PoLaR labels.","The main problem with the analysis is that the dependent variable chosen does not enable the authors to address the question of typicality, as they examine whether the noun, adjective or both were focused (and, in the second model, whether there is a difference between adjective focus and other types of focus, as noun and adjective + noun seem to be marked similarly). Typicality is not included in the models.

The predictors are the results of the K-means analysis, in the form of the accent type for each word – suggesting that for each utterance, only one of the three variables (“AdjAccentTpe”, “NAccentType”, and “AdjNAccented”) contains a value, the other two being NAs (as each utterance has either the Adj, the N or both in focus). => is that a pb? Feels weird
Some additional acoustic measures were also included in the original model. However, their exact nature is not clear. It is written p2 that these are “acoustic variables of the utterance”, but authors report in the questionnaire that they “focused [their] analysis on the region of each utterance containing the determiner, adjective, and noun in the second half”. We therefore don’t know whether the f0 measures included are for the whole utterance, the NP in the second half of the utterance, or the focused word. These variables are however not kept in the final, simplified model.
In the end, the model seems to predict whether the adjective is in focus or not based on whether there is an accent on the Noun or not – the authors note than the most important factors are “about simple presence or absence of an accent”, with the specific type of accent as identified in the k-means analysis only “playing a much minor role”. The analysis does not seem very informative in the end and, again, does not address the question of typicality.","The structure seems appropriate but a lot of information is missing (package used, number of trees, number of predictors used in the random forests model). The formula for the k-means clustering analysis is missing.","The authors used only the data in the “medium typicality” condition. While their reason for doing so (only condition where there was an equal number of observations across focus types) makes sense regarding the research questions they chose to investigate, it is problematic as the common research question for the MSA project was to investigate how speakers phonetically change their utterance to reflect the typicality of the association between noun and adjective. The chosen subsets of the data cannot therefore contribute to answering the research question.","No transformations were performed, although the authors note that PoLaR annotations transform f0 values to scaled or normed pitch levels.",NA,0

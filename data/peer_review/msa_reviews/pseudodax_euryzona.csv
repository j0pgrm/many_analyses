pseudodax_euryzona,75,60,70,publishable with minor revision.,"There is no information about the demographics of the annotators. Are these native speakers of German or not? And although the paper notes that one annotator went over all examples again, after the four annotators were done, it is unclear what this annotator checked exactly. Did they also look at the individual annotations, or just resolve issues that were flagged by the original annotators? Thus it is not clear how reliable the annotations are. The choice to test the hypothesis on s2 and not on the other possible components seems to be driven by the data itself, and thus needs to be corrected for multiple comparisons. It is not completely clear how many comparisons have been considered (but at least the other component and the intercept)._",The analysis using a linear model is sound.,"Capturing pitch tracks with PCA analysis indeed allows for quantitative analysis of potentially qualitative effects. The choice for the variable has not been motivated, but such a motivation may easily be given (and was not required for the current analysis document)","Duration, or any other variable, has not been considered directly, but may have direct or indirect effects",A random effect for the effect of the adjective+noun  combination may have improved model fit (as some nouns are much longer than others).,"There is no explict choice to exclude data, though the dataset also contains many examples in other focus conditions, for which typicality can be derived. The exclusion of outliers (above or below 3 SD from the mean) is reasonable and sound.","The transformation using PCAs is appropriate and may allow to quantify interesting features that are not simple mean shifts in pitch. However, the decision to pick the best component of two is not clearly motivated (why not try mulitple components)? The effect size (and significances) may change with analyses of the other components.","One of the members of our group may know who (one of the) author(s) of this analysis is, due to a username still being present in the Praat script, and the unfortunate coincidence of this group member having seen the author's username when both were colleagues. However, we do not think this knowledge has affected our judgement and we have no conflict of interest.",2
pseudodax_euryzona,90,90,90,publishable as is.,The analysis is sound. Most methodological decisions regardind the phonetic and statistical analysis make sense given the problem at hand.,"The use of Functional Principal Component Analysis seems a good fit, given the problem at hand. The fact that the test material consisted of phrases differing in the number of words and the words differed in terms of metrical makeup, FPCA is a way of quantifying differences when there is no fine-grained alignment between contour and individual syllables.","Given the instruction to choose one dependent variable, analysing the contours using Functional Principal Component Analysis is a good fit, because the PCA's encapsulate overall changes in the shape of contours. Independent variables were a more obvious choice, given that teams were instructed to explicitly look for the effect of typicality on the f0 contours.","Given the choice of using Functional Principal Component Analysis, the inclusion of PCAs as variables in the statistical models are more or less obvious and suitable.","The model chosen was pretty straightforward: linear mixed-effects with the second PC score as the response variable, typicality as the fixed effect and a by-speaker random intercept. It is very appropriate for the problem at hand.",F0 contours were normalized using z-score and contours excluded when data points in it exceeded a threshold of z > |3|. The rationale for it is reasonable and the use of a threshold may have avoided the inclusion of f0 extraction errors.,"
F0 contours were normalized using z-score. This transformation is appropriate, given that the dataset was comprised of contours produced by different speakers and it would be a problem to aggregate all contours without any type of transformation. Z-score is a good choice to minimize f0 effects due to differences in speaker sex and other physiological factors that affect f0.",NA,3
pseudodax_euryzona,95,40,70,publishable with major revision.,"The model was not adjusted for the tokens random effect for word level or sentence level.  There are only two minor points that I noticed. The authors wrote that they considered several ways of tackling the research question (at the word level, sentence level, prepositional phrase level), but they do not give reasons why they decided to examine the last five words at the end. Also, it is not clearly defined what is meant by silence between two words (e.g. the duration of the break).  
Very minor point regarding the selection of ""random"" variables in Figure 1: they don't mention what method was used to ""randomly"" select the data --this matters because computers can only simulate randomness, so the package should be reported.",Very good.,very good.,very good.,"One thing was missing in the structure of the statistical model, ( 1 | token level) & ( 1 | sentence level)","very good. These choices were sound (and basically the same ones we made, just  with fewer error categories). They only included those with typicality judgements and eliminated tokens that likely would have had abnormal prosodic contours.","Their normalization procedures were appropriate, and the scaling they did to make the z-scores more Hz-like is helpful when interpreting f0 data. Their interpolation of undefined data points was also fine.",NA,1
pseudodax_euryzona,65,70,68,publishable with minor revision.,"This was a difficult analysis to rate, as none of our team members know enough about FPCA to properly evaluate it. In general, we are unclear why not modelling pitch contours with something more directly interpretable was warranted, and this doesn't seem to be strongly motivated. Our understanding of PCA more broadly for dimensionality reduction doesn't seem to be relevant here given the simplicity of the design and a small number of relevant predictors. As this method is not standard, it should have been explained in depth, and not referenced the reader to other papers.","We were not able to recreate the analysis based on the given materials, as we encountered a number of issues running the code, possibly due to namespace issues of unspecified packages, so we were not able to check if the models were appropriately specified.","The variables of s1 and s2 were not particularly well explained, so this is difficult to evaluate.","Regarding the inclusion of PC1 and PC2, there was no mention of why they were included and why the remaining principle components were excluded. This is an important aspect to include while using standard PCA, so if this does not apply to FPCA it needs to be made explicit.","Again, this was hard to evaluate as we were not able to run the code and check this for ourselves, and no model diagnostic plots were provided by the authors. One issue with the model is that speaker and/or stimulus variance components made up one of the dependent variables, which to us makes the interpretation of the statistical models strange.",NA,We have a small issue with the fact that f0 values were interpolated when the true value in voiceless sounds should be undefined.,NA,2

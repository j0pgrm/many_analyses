comanthina_maculatus,95,90,92,publishable with major revision.,"The phonetic analysis seemed straightforward. Perhaps Praat is known to be not the best tool for F0 though and there didn't appear to be any sort of data verification/checking, etc.","I appreciate that the author was aware of the assumptions of an ANOVA and chose to run non-parametric tests instead. However, as far as I know, a two-tailed unpaired t-test is parametric.","Variable selection seemed fine, although there wasn't much discussion of what independent variables were included in the model. A more robust analysis would have perhaps logged the durations and added speaker and/or word as random effects.",The dependent variables make sense. The independent variables could have been augmented with word and speaker as random effects.,"Again, a more robust analysis would have added speaker and/or word as random effects.",There didn't appear to be any discussion of exclusions.,A more robust analysis would have perhaps logged the durations.,NA,1
comanthina_maculatus,65,35,50,publishable with major revision.,"We rated this project with 50 as we do not believe this is enough data in the subset used to substantiate the claims made in this report. The phonetic analysis seems fine, but we have reservations about the statistical analysis. The methods seem rather vague. The data visualisation was however very well done. What also needs to be more explicitly stated is how these variables were actually measured, was it at mid-point? means?","T-tests were used as the data was found to be non-normal, these are however also parametric tests and are bound by the same assumptions of normality. While t-tests may be fairly robust, there are other more appropriate tests available which would also allow for the inclusion of more variables. The non-normality is essentially not addressed here regarding the use of t-tests.","Variable choice is not addressed in detail, referencing for these variables is not sufficient and it is unclear which references (and what parts thereof) have informed these decisions. Variable selection was limited by the choice of t-tests.",See above,"Again the structure was heavily restricted by the use of t-tests. The T-tests do seem to have been carried out correctly, with the correct structures, but see our previous comment about normality.","Limiting the data to a subset is understandable given the work it takes to code by hand, but it is problematic here. In our experience, even 30 speakers was on the lower side of what we felt was necessary for this kind of analysis. At a minimum, it would be necessary to state how these 15 were selected. It might have been interesting to include the colour adjectives too (it is understandable that this was not included because of time).","Great that residuals of the model were checked, however transformations that are able to deal with non-normality might have been a better route than opting for t-tests. With transformed data the assumptions of your model might have been better met.
","The methods need to be clearer and more explicit. Even with the material that has been provided, it would be very difficult to replicate this study in the way that it has been done here. For example, how did you run your statistical tests? Was it with R? SPSS? Something else? What normality test was conducted?

The visualisation was a clever way of showing the results of the variables!",1
comanthina_maculatus,10,5,7,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"There are several major concerns related to the statistical analysis. Overall, there is not enough detail in the report to enable replication. Here are some of the specific major issues.
First, only 15 participants were included, lowering the power the analyses. Second, it appears that measurements were taken from the nouns (focus condition is unspecified), as opposed to the adjectives and no rationale was provided. As the former were not counterbalanced across the conditions, there might be confounds on the measurements due to vowel category and segmental context, as pointed out by the authors. Third, the statistical models do not include a random structure, which may increase the risk of false positives. Fourth, the authors do not report effect sizes, making the interpretation of their statistical results difficult and not fulfilling the task requirement. Fifth, while the authors point to some references regarding the choice of variables to study, they could have been better integrated to provide a stronger argument. Lastly, they tested multiple independent variables and do not report  a single effect size with a rationale to research question, as per the requirements of the task.

A positive aspect of their approach is that the authors checked if the data fulfils the assumptions for an ANOVA test and took steps to correct for that using some non-parametric test and some alpha adjustment.","The report does not make explicit what model was used to generate the final results. It appears that the authors may have used either Mann-Whitney U-Tests or Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests. At one point in the report they refer to them as unpaired non-parametric t-tests and in another part they say that they carried out pairwise comparisons. In either case these models assume independence of observations, which is violated in the provided dataset, as each participants provided multiple data points. This may lead to increased risk of false positive results. They also do not report how they adjusted the alpha levels.
",The authors justified their choice of dependent variables using references but did not integrate them clearly in the report. They tested multiple independent variables and did not report which one specifically is the one answer to the research question.,"It appears that each of the models only included one dependent and independent variable, which are appropriate, considering the research question. We have already addressed our concern that there are three analyses of three independent variables given that the task requires one answer. We have already addressed our concern that the models do not include random effects.",Too little information is provided for us to be able to provide feedback on the structure of the models.,"Data labelled as “noise” or “error” was appropriately excluded. It is not completely clear if the authors excluded adjectives from the analysis. Including nouns is problematic, as the nouns were not balanced across the three typicality conditions. Their varying segmental and syllabic composition, stress pattern and length may lead to confounds in the typicality condition, as pointed out by the authors. 
No justification is provided for only including 15 participants. This lowers the power of the statistical analysis and may increase the risk of type II errors. Also no information is provided about the basis on which the remaining participants were included.
As Praat f0 measurements sometimes produce values that are 2x higher or lower than the real values, checking for and filtering out of extreme values would have been appropriate.
The authors report excluding pretonic and posttonic measurements, so it is unclear how many data points were included at the end. It is unclear what was the rationale behind these choices.
","We believe that given that the RQ is interested in within-speaker variation and the amount of data per speaker is balanced, the lack of transformations would not be an issue, if it was clearer what data were included in the analyses.","The report is overall lacking in detail. The use of R software had to be implied from the manual provided in the supplementary results. The procedure for extracting measurements could have been described in more detail, without having to refer to the provided Praat script. The author of the Praat script is not cited. As segmentation was carried out by hand, more detail should have been included to describe the visual criteria used to label onsets and offsets of segments. The provided example textgrid does not reference the exact sound file and location, so its addition has not been helpful.",0
comanthina_maculatus,16,10,13,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"They only analyzed (coded) half of the data – I guess because of lack of time as they have done the coding manually (without using a forced aligner)
They did not take the condition (AF, NF, ANF) into account in their analysis, which lead to false conclusion because the effect of the condition is wrongly attributed to the typicality.
As ANOVA could not be applied here, they used t-test without explicitly correcting for multiple comparisons (unless I got it wrong) 
","The choice of doing multiple t-test does not seem good to me, as there are more than two modalities to compare. And it does not allow to take random factors into account.","Several dependent variables (which is not following the guidelines)
The process of structuring the statistical model is not really explained (since it’s t-test).
I acknowledge one good thing is that they rejected ANOVA because of the non-normal residuals.
","The condition should have been included as a fixed factor in the model as it clearly influences the prosody. (And not taking into account the condition leads to false conclusion on the effect of typicality)
The typicality has been included as a 3-modalities factor while I would prefer using the continuous variable typ_mean or typ_median not to loose information.
",I don’t know if we can speak about the model structure given that they only did some t-test. I would say the structure is not appropriate.,"Their choice is okay except that they did not analyzed half of the data (probably because they lack time I guess) which is not acceptable to me. They excluded errors properly, which is good. They did not exclude any outlier, which should have been done I think.","It’s okay. No transformation was applied, and I don’t think it would have been relevant.",NA,0

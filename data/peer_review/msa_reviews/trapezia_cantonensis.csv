trapezia_cantonensis,86,86,86,publishable with minor revision.,"We really enjoyed reading this analysis, it was very well presented and the graphics were very clear and informative. We believe there are only some minor issues in the report.

There are some confusing typos in the report, for example, the introduction talks about three measurements, 1.1 talks about 4. Under 3.4 non-food treatments are significantly longer than non-food treatments? In places, information is missing for example on how vowel formants were normalised.","GAMMs are appropriate for the dynamic F0 and intensity data. Likewise, the mixed model is appropriate for the static vowel duration data.",The process seems fine and to make sense with what is in the published literature.,It is unclear why only the adjective was chosen for analysis over other possible variables such as the noun. It is also not completely clear what typicality measure was used in the models.,The process seems fine and to make sense with what is in the published literature.,"The author focuses exclusively on the adjective of the NP. Considering the noun is in focus position, it would make sense to explore the adjective and noun in tandem. Any increases in intensity, F0, etc. could in principle be accompanied by a similar increase in the noun – or not. Looking at adjective and nouns gives us a fuller picture of what is happening. 

The author focuses exclusively on the stressed vowel. While other options are possible, this strikes us as a justified choice as any typicality-based modulation should be captured by looking at the vowel only.
","F0 data are notoriously often non-normal, it would be good to have an idea of what the distribution looked like. The author is not terribly specific about how normal these data were. It is also unclear how higher and lower voice types (which might differ significantly between speakers) was considered in the analysis.",Thanks for an interesting read!,2
trapezia_cantonensis,75,50,60,publishable with major revision.,"Overall, the phonetic analysis was done very well, and we appreciated the effort taken to complete the segmentation manually. 
However, there is some concern about the choice of GAMM analysis regarding whether it is an appropriate choice for answering the research question. The research question itself would demand an analysis that gave more absolute results, rather than how outcome variables changed over time (see below discussion on GAMM).

Another concern was the treatment of some of the variables which did not have random slopes. In addition, the choice of including ‘adjective’ as a predictor instead of as a random intercept is not clearly justified. 

A major concern is the inclusion of ‘non-food’ items as one of the levels of typicality. The reason for this is not provided and predictions about it as a variable are not provided, further questioning its inclusion. It is difficult to take the results at face value without post-hoc tests to see if any of the effects are the results of an influence of the ‘non-food’ items. Further, ‘non-food’ was not included as part of the duration lmer model and was found to be non-significant – why a difference in choosing to disregard ‘non-food’ here? 

Results for variables other than duration seemed to be confirmed from visual inspection of graphs rather than the results of the GAMMs themselves. It is also unclear how the graphs are arrived at. The method of confirming results is not consistent or reasoned. While we generally agree with the interpretations of the results, one of the author’s statements raised a question.

There appear to be editorial errors in several sections such as the F0 section suggesting that results from another section were copied but not adjusted. 

Finally, a single effect size and confidence interval was not reported, which was one of the objectives of the analysis. This is problematic as a final answer to the research question is not provided. Despite some of these issues, within each individual analysis the author had a principled approach.","Linear mixed models seem appropriate for the continuous duration variables analysed, considering that multiple participants responded to the same stimuli and that the same words (for adjectives) occurred in different conditions.

The choice of a GAMM analysis was not well documented. We consider that its output might provide information, which is not well aligned to the research question. The research question is about the overall difference (zero, positive or negative) between the dependent variable levels, rather than the change of outcome variables over time. A GAMM analysis shows whether the dependent variable has a non-linear effect on the outcome variable, in this case with respect to normalised time, without directly addressing the author’s hypothesis of higher or lower f0/intensity/formants. Given how the author specified their hypotheses and the research question, the choice of a GAMM analysis is questionable.

In addition, this information is interpreted secondarily from the plots and the method of arriving at the plots are unclear. 

Finally, the task was to provide an effect size and CI and the author did not know of a way to do that with GAMM. Therefore, we think the choice of analysis type was not appropriate.","The choice of variables was based on the author’s prior knowledge of stress in world languages. While they were reasonable in our opinion, the choice was not motivated beyond that.

We think that duration should have been included as a random slope per speaker and token. Also, we are unsure why adjective was included as a predictor in the GAMM analyses and not as a random intercept.","While we agree with the exclusion of non-foods from the duration analysis, it is unclear what the benefits were to include them in analyses of other variables. The author explicitly states that they have no expectations for the non-food items and in the norming document the non-foods are explicitly described as agnostic to typicality (hence separate from the RQ).",We think that duration should have been included as a random slope per speaker and token. Why was adjective included as a predictor in the GAMM analyses and not as a random intercept?,"The exclusion of ‘non-food’ for the duration model but its inclusion for all the other variable models is not justified and could have had an influence on the results. However, it is unclear what influence, if any, ‘non-food’ had on the effects found as no post-hoc tests were conducted. 

We also noticed that there were no representations of atypical instances of “orange” in the plots and were wondering why that data are missing.","We believe that given that the RQ is interested in within-speaker variation, the lack of transformations is not an issue.","In several sections the author seems to have made editorial errors in their reporting and interpretation of the results, citing an outcome variable from a different section or comparing a level of the dependent variable to itself, leading to lower clarity.

We think that not reporting a final effect size and CI is an issue, given the task.

While we agree with the interpretation that typicality having an effect on formants could be a false positive, the author’s interpretation of the results raises a question. They suggest that the results are a false positive because the direction of the effect is different from what was predicted. Would a result in the predicted direction merit being considered a true positive, given the same hypothetical power of the analysis?

We also noticed that the analysis of the previous team we reviewed resulted in lower intensity for atypical tokens, which is the opposite of what was found here. This is unexpected since everyone analysed the same dataset.",1
trapezia_cantonensis,75,26,36,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"The author seems to have ignored the focus condition (AF, NF, ANF), which could have an important impact on the analysis.
The use of GAMMs appears very flawed for this analysis. All p-values are extremely significant, yet in the analysis the author concludes for one model that there is no consistent effect at all, for one model that there is possibly a small effect, and for one model that there is a large effect. This calls into question the purpose of using a significance criterion at all, especially without reporting an effect size.
We note that they did not follow the guideline to choose only one dependent variable (instead they analyzed formants, pitch, duration and intensity separately).","The choice of generalized additive mixed models for pitch, intensity and formants appears deeply flawed. All models were highly significant, but the author seems to focus his/her analysis entirely on the graphs, with very different conclusions for each model. Above all there is no justification for using such complex models and linear mixed models could have been sufficient. I believe it’s better to choose simple models and only use more complex models when simple models are not suitable.
The choice of a linear mixed model for the duration analysis appears sensible.
","The process is not very clear, there is no explanation about why the focus condition (AF, NF, ANF) was ignored.
Without being an expert on GAMMs, it is difficult to check whether the models’ assumptions were respected.
The author did not explain why they choose the categorical encoding for typicality (rather than the continuous scale e.g. typ_mean or typ_median). 
","The author ignored the focus condition (AF, NF, ANF), with no justification. This means that the typicality conditions were not properly balanced with regards to focus (for example the “non-food” typicality value was not present in the AF condition, when the focus of the sentence was on the adjective).
The choice to use the categorical encoding for typicality (rather than the continuous scale typ_mean or typ_median) is not a very good choice because some information is lost by reducing a continuous scale down to a 4-categories factor, with the “non-food” category in particular not easily interpreted in relation to the others.
","I do not entirely understand the transformation operated to take into accounts the different formants in the first GAAM, but I have to question the suitability of a model that can be extremely significant without the data showing any consistent direction.
For the other GAMMs, the author’s analysis appears mostly based on certain conditions being consistently higher or lower than others, which calls into question the use of a time-series analysis rather than just using an average value over the whole interval.
","Trials marked as errors were not apparently rejected, with no explanation either way. The author only excluded outliers for the F0 analysis, choosing to exclude the samples with F0 equal to 0 while keeping the samples around them. This could be a questionable strategy, depending on the proportion of samples with f0=0, and whether samples around them would have artificially low F0. There is not much information on this.","The author does not appear to have transformed the data, which is fine to me",NA,0
trapezia_cantonensis,95,60,70,publishable with major revision.,"The analysis of typicality effects in adjective-noun phrasal combinations focuses on vowel formant trajectories, F0 trajectories, and duration of the stressed vowels of the adjectives in the phrases. From a linguistic viewpoint, the analysis is compelling and exhaustive, and would meet publication standards with minor revision to enhance the clarity of the decision pipeline in case of ambiguities in boundary segmentation.
Similarly, the choise of the statistical approach using generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) is optimal, in that it considers the likely high correlation between the response variables (typicality levels per each type of feature extracted). However, the application of the statistical approahc and the intrpretation of the results appears not to be smooth enough, and warrants a thorough revision.
","The author creates three spearate GAMM models with one predictor for each model, tested against the null model obtained by removing the predictor while preserving the random effects, and looking at AIC as a way of assessing the predictive model.  
Including all the terms in one GAMM model, rather than creating three separate models, could have resulted in a better estimate of the effects as the terms of choice are likely also correlated. For example, this would allow checking the effects of typicality on F0 while accounting for differences in intensity.","Unless we are misinterpreting the results, it seems that Figures 1,2,3 show that data  selection is only partially comparable across adjectives. For example, for BRAUNEN the non-food category is not represented, while for ORANGEN the atypical is missing. This potentially leads to glitches in the overall interpretation of the effects of typicality across adjectives.",See above,"One particular issue with the authors' interpretation of the statistical results is hard to understand from our viewpoint, and would require major revision. Namely, the inference that typicality is not a significant predictor of vowel formant trajectory differences, notwithstanding the fact that the model with that predictor is significant. The authors conclude that this is merely statistical noise, and hence there is no meaningful difference, but this conclusion seems unwarranted, as the authors must be bound to the fact that their model is significant, regardless of the fact that one of their assumptions, namely that the effects are ordered from atypical to typical, is not borne out.","See above, regarding the comparability between the results fro each adjective category.",-,NA,1

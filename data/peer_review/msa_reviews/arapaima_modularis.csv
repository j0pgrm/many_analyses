arapaima_modularis,100,100,100,publishable as is.,"The report explains in detail their approach to the question, how they segmented the files, exclusion criteria, statistical analysis, descriptive and analyzed statistics, and conclusion.","Given the statistical setup, I find the choice of a repeated measure ANOVA fitting.","They decided to measure Pitch and determine if it is modulated by the three levels of typicality, which fits the research question as provided.","As the participant information given was that the group was homogeneous, there were no extralinguistic variables to include; pitch as a function of typicality, so to speak, is how they created the model, which is minimal but fully adequate given the approach.","Given the RQ and approach selected, it was suitable.",The exclusion of outliers and tokens with errors was adequately addressed.,NA,NA,3
arapaima_modularis,95,100,98,publishable as is.,This was a relatively straightforward but thoroughly documented analysis. No red flags anywhere in the analysis pipeline or in the statistics.,ANOVA was a good choice for what this team was doing. My one complaint is that adding speaker as a random effect might have been helpful.,"There were two variables, pitch and treatment. Very straightforward and justified in a brief review in the beginning.","The model itself was fine, though it would have been perhaps better to include speaker as a random effect.",The model's structure was fine.,"This team excluded creaky voice, which is understandable given that they were focused on pitch. But, I recall seeing a lot of creaky voice, so I wonder if there was a lot of data excluded.",No transformations as far as I could tell.,"I appreciate the thorough documentation of how the data was collected, the author's confessions of limited German and how that affected the data collection, and the detailed statistical output.",3
arapaima_modularis,64,60,60,publishable with major revision.,"The choice of statistical test was appropriate. The analytic steps are well-documented and easy to follow. We are concerned about the number of exclusions, and the fact that entire speakers were removed instead of just the outliers. Removing outliers in this way is potentially very problematic. Mean F0 measures are removed, meaning all results for those speakers are now lost. If outliers are going to be removed, this should be done on the raw data points, these individual points can then be removed. It is not very surprising that no variation was found here as substantial degrees of variation have potentially been removed.","The choice of statistical test was appropriate. However, normality was checked on the raw data, not on the model residuals, running the ANOVA residuals on the data given shows that the residuals are fairly normally distributed, but could be improved with transformation.","Pitch and typicality were appropriate for this analysis. Pitch was selected and motivated by reference to ""many languages"", it is possible that German might rely more on intensity for the purpose of accentuation (e.g., Gut 2009: 138).

Gut, Ulrike. 2009. Introduction to English Phonetics and Phonology. Frankfurt: Peter Lang.",It would have been beneficial to have looked at more variables (e.g. intensity/ duration).  We wonder what the effect of voice-type was on the exclusion criteria (i.e. lower and higher voices indexing gender).,ANOVA structure was fine. It would have been good to select a statistical test that allows inclusion of random effects for speaker and word (at minimum).,"Using mean values (of the max) is problematic as the difference between max values at higher frequencies (in Hz) is potentially less meaningful than at lower frequencies. The analysis might have been more informative with actual mean values, rather than the mean of the max. 

As mentioned above, removing speakers completely, rather than just the individual measurements is potentially problematic.","It may have been beneficial to transform the data, as the residuals do not appear to be normally distributed (this shouldn't be too much of an issue for robust statistical tests however).","The methods are nice and clear, we really enjoyed the thorough description of the acoustic analysis. The author makes some very good observations regarding creak, pitch excursions, etc. and treats the data accordingly.

sphyrna_ellioti,85,95,93,publishable with minor revision.,"While this is generally an appropriate acoustic analysis, we have some concerns about the inclusion of intensity as a variable as well as need for more detail about measurement. For intensity, we donâ€™t think it is an appropriate variable to include without more information about how the study was conducted and what the recording conditions were. We would also like a description of heuristics for flagging/manual measurement of implausible values generated during the automated analysis, such as inconceivably short aligned intervals, high/low F0 outliers, and a missingness analysis for files not surviving automatic analysis. Finally, how was the by-talker centering of F0 conducted?","The mixed effects models were appropriate for the analysis. Use of Bayesian models would have allowed for a greater ability to use maximal random effects structure. However, frequentist models are sufficient for the analysis.","While the analysis was thorough, it was more broad than the research question posed, mainly due to the inclusion of the focus condition. Rather, simply including typicality and part of speech would be sufficient to answer the research question. 
","The variables included were suitable, but other relevant variables may have been excluded, such as spectral tilt (Aronov & Schweitzer, 2016).
",The structure of the statistical model was appropriate for the analyses.,"The author included all of the data, including all conditions (NF, AF, ANF). This may have influenced the findings for the NF condition, since condition affected prosody in all of the analyses. It would be helpful to learn whether excluding the AF and ANF conditions lead to the same results.",Why were the transformations for duration/F0 used? A sentence explaining each would have been helpful here.,NA,2
sphyrna_ellioti,40,40,40,publishable with major revision.,"Both the phonetic analysis and the statistical analysis are difficult to interpret. Our main issues were that the effect of typicality is buried in interactions with focus and condition, and the focus of the analysis seems to be on the focus condition rather than the typicality condition; the authors did not make predictions for their models, and it's unclear how to interpret interactions between part of speech and focus condition effects on the prosodic features used as dependent variables. As a more minor issue, using three measures of F0 at different points in a word is also difficult to interpret considering the different word lengths and word structures.",The liner mixed-effects model is a reasonable approach to this analysis.,"Overall, the choice of variables was sufficient. The independent variables were all necessary, but it is unclear what the predictions are regarding nouns and focus conditions other than adjective focus. The interactions between part of speech, focus condition, and typicality are difficult to interpret and seem to highlight the focus effects rather than the typicality effects. The focus conditions were unbalanced and it's unclear how that affected the results. 
",The variables were suitable to include in a model investigating the effect of typicality on prosodic realization.,"As stated previously, the structure of the model placed the effect of the variable of interest (typicality) inside a two- or three-way interaction and made interpretation difficult.","The choice to include nouns as well as adjectives was interesting, but the design of the analysis given that the focus conditions weren't balanced across groups made interpretation difficult.",Log transformation of word duration was appropriate,"We had reservations about interpreting complex interactions in the linear mixed-effects model, especially when those complex interactions included the main variable addressing the research question. The unbalanced nature of the focus condition indicated to us that the experiment was designed to test the adjective-focused condition, and we're not clear whether using an unbalanced data set had an effect on the model results.  We question the validity of the interpretation of the results using data from multiple conditions that was collected during an experiment designed to investigate a specific condition.",1
sphyrna_ellioti,90,90,90,publishable as is.,"This analysis is clearly explained and each step has been described in detail. All files are available and I have not found errors. The limitations have been described by the team (the authors expected typicality to have been independently manipulated independent of the condition, which was not the case and had to be taken into consideration during the analysis).","Linear mixed effects models in this case allow to check statistical significance of the effect so the tests was chosen correctly to my knowledge. It takes into consideration random effects, therefore this analysis is more suitable than simple linear regression.","I am not an expert but to my knowledge the model was fitted in appropriately and the predictors were selected and implemented in the analysis logically. Dependent variables were log duration, intensity, and F0 for critical words (adjective + noun), which are aligned with the research questions. 

Assumptions were checked and where necessary, log transformations were employed.","The team aimed to check  whether the typicality of a modifier-noun pair affected how the words were said, so they chose to focus on the duration, intensity, and F0 of the adjective and noun pairs. The choice of variables allows to answer the research question.

Typicality mean scores instead of the typicality factor was used in the model as not all typicality was represented for all conditions, which might have had an influence on the results (no obvious effect of this variable) but this was due to the data that the team worked with.",I have not found anything that would be worrying or needed rethinking.,"The authors focused on noun phrases only (adjective + noun) and no other exclusions have been made. The focus on adjective + noun data only is motivated by the fact that these were the manipulated words, which means the effect should be the easiest to detect. This allowed the authors to narrow the analysis.","Log transformations were used to address distribution, which is correct in this case.","I am not an expert but to my knowledge, this analysis has been done correctly.",3
sphyrna_ellioti,40,60,45,publishable with major revision.,"This analysis aimed to examine typicality differences in duration, intensity, and F0 of the adjective-noun pair. The data processing steps were appropriate, especially the use of the MFA and the specified Praat scripts. However, the authors are not specific about which tokens they were examining, saying at one point that they were interested in the modifier-noun pair, but never further explaining whether they were looking at properties of the noun or of the adjective. Though this becomes apparent later when examining the model, their narrative description should have better detailed these choices. The choices of models and visualizations was also appropriate for their research question, but this analysis contains a critical flaw. By examining F0, duration, and intensity at the word level, the authors did not control for the fact that different segments have different expected properties. Crucially, by measuring F0 at the word onset, offset, and midpoint, they necessarily captured F0 values during some voiced and some voiceless segments, without controlling for segment identity. Similarly, by measuring the entire word duration and intensity, they introduced a lot of variation related to the fact that different words simply have different segments with different properties. This creates so much noise in the data as to make their claims very unreliable. A better method would have been to either control for segment identity, or to limit the analysis to vowels in the words and conditions of interest.","The choice of statistical type was appropriate, and we appreciate their thoughtful choices with respect to data analysis. However, the strength of their statistics is somewhat undermined by the choice of variables, which has the outcome of producing results that are not reliable. These limitations are further discussed below.","First and foremost, a major and critical flaw in the model is that they measured F0, intensity, and duration at the word level, as mentioned above. Since they did not control for the different segments, these measures will be so variant as to be meaningless in comparing values across typicality conditions.

In addition, the authors do not provide extensive justification for their choice of variables; essentially they are just looking for differences between typicality conditions. They do not state the direction of their hypotheses for these variables, which is a major limitation. Do the authors expect longer duration, lower/higher F0 or lower/higher intensity for entire words in the atypical condition, without controlling for segments at all? If so, what motivates these hypotheses?
","The acoustic variables were suitable for measuring acoustic differences between typicality conditions, though again, the authors did not provide a hypothesis or motivation for the variables they chose. The authors also did not control for effects of speaker, which is a major flaw given that this data set contains both male and female speakers, and F0 and intensity have been shown to vary predictably by gender. F0 measurements therefore should have been normalized, and speaker should have been added as a random effect in their model.","The choice of a linear mixed effects model was appropriate.  The model included their variables of interest, but was limited by the fact that the F0 and intensity data was not normalized for important speaker characteristics (especially gender) which should have been included.",N/A,"We think the authors should have normalized f0 (e.g., as a z-score according to speaker) to run measures on data that come from a variety of speakers.","There is a lot of good work here particularly in the data cleaning and statistical setup, but there are critical changes that would need to be made for the results to be meaningful: the normalization of F0 and intensity measures for each speaker, and a focus on a smaller target than the word-level, for the reasons discussed above. In addition, the authors are strongly encouraged to revisit the direction of effects in their hypotheses and to be explicit about what motivates these hypotheses.",1

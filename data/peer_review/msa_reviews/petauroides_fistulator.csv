petauroides_fistulator,35,30,30,publishable with major revision.,"Based on our findings about this analysis explained in several of the questions below, we do not believe the finding that Atypical has lower f0 than other conditions is reliable.  Our concerns that led to this judgment are based both in the phonetics and the statistics of the analysis.  At a very general level, this analysis seems to use entirely automated procedures to extract the data for analysis, with no requirement that the researcher ever listen to the recordings or look at spectrograms.  We understand that an entirely automated method is both more expedient and more replicable than one that involves human judgments based on the spectrogram, but we do wonder if the avoidance of hands-on phonetic methods led to some of the concerns we note below about creaky voice, inclusion of hesitations, and inclusion of production errors.","We feel the choice of statistical analysis type could be a very good method, if implemented differently on several points. The approach as it stands uses a GAMM fitted to the f0 curve over the duration of the noun, which includes several random smoothing factors in the GAMM as well as the fixed factor of interest (Typicality), and assesses significance of the coefficients for the Typicality effects in the resulting model.  The points we feel would need to be implemented differently to give reliable results are explained below.","Dependent variable: Most of our concerns about this model stem from choice and implementation of the dependent variable, f0 track over the duration of the noun, automatically extracted after automatic labeling of the noun.
•	Noun vs. adjective measurements: This analysis analyzed only f0 during the noun, not the adjective.  Nouns are not matched across conditions in this experimental design; adjectives are.  (That is, Typicality is a between-items factor if the dependent variable is in the noun but a within-items factor if the dependent variable is within the adjective.)  Even if one predicts that the effect is most likely to be realized on the noun, it's a shame to waste the power and lower error variability offered by the item-matching of the adjectives.  Reasoning for this choice was not addressed in the write-up.  The unmatched nouns may also introduce some confounds because of how the GAMM was fit across the duration of the nouns, addressed below.
•	Creaky voice: This analysis used Praat's automatic f0 measurements at 10 ms intervals throughout the noun.  This has the advantage of being able to capture differences anywhere in the f0 curve over the noun, as opposed to measuring the peak f0, for example.  However, it is unclear how creaky voice may have affected this dependent variable.  We expect that the GAMM could probably fit to an f0 track that shifts suddenly from creak to modal voice or vice versa (e.g. halving or doubling) with a very steep slope to one part of the “wiggly” curve.  However, this would treat creak as simply very low pitch on a continuous scale, not a categorically different kind of voicing.  We believe there is substantial creak at the end of the nouns for most speakers (between noun-final schwa and vowel-initial “ablegen”), and in other parts of the noun for a few speakers.  Any measure that includes creaky voice as simply very low pitch on a continuous scale, as this one does, is likely to have the outcome strongly influenced by how much creak each token happens to have where in the noun, which is relatively unlikely to be a linguistically meaningful realization of a Typicality difference.  Even if the creak were a realization of a Typicality effect, it would be misleading to present it as a difference on a continuous f0 variable.

Time variable: Because the ID variable (time) is set to 10 ms windows throughout the duration of the noun, number of IDs (number of 10 ms windows) varies widely across tokens.  Of necessity, there is very little data left at the later IDs (nouns that happen to have been pronounced with the longest duration), and that data is not well distributed across Typicality conditions.  We used the authors’ R script to analyze the distribution of data somewhat further, and found that there is very little data past about ID 50, bringing any effect toward the end of the IDs into doubt.  We would prefer the time factor for the GAMM fitting to use frames at each 5% of duration of the noun, or something comparable, to spread the presumed intonation curves to the same range.  (We have a histogram by ID, but it won't paste in here.) 
 
Lack of a stress placement factor:  No factor seems to have been tried in the model for which syllable of the noun stress falls on.  Since the nouns are not matched across Typicality conditions and stress placement would be expected to have a large effect on f0, this could introduce a substantial confound.  Noun stress placement varies from first syllable (e.g. Gurke) to third syllable (e.g. Mandarine).  It is possible, however, that using the noun (item) as a random smoothing factor helps with this.
","We take this question to be about the final choice of model, as opposed to the model selection process (previous question).  

Large number of random smooth terms: This analysis includes competitor name, competitor color, distractor 1 name, distractor 1 color, distractor 2 name, and distractor 2 color as random factors, in addition to identity of the noun, identity of the adjective, trial number, and the obvious random factor of speaker.  Our understanding of this method is that if having one of the distractors be red, or be a clothespin, happens to make a difference in how people say the target phrase, including random smooth terms for everything on the screen gives the model a place to appropriately put that source of variability.  We can see the potential advantage of allowing random terms for all of these potential sources of variability, but since the distractors and competitors are carefully distributed across items in the experimental design, we suspect that not including these random smooth terms would make a much simpler model with little loss in what can be interpreted.  This is a very high number of random factors, and we were surprised that there apparently were no problems with failure to converge.  Furthermore, since the target adjective is predictable from the target noun (each noun occurs only with a single adjective), we were unsure about the benefit of including random smooth terms for both separately.

Stress placement: As discussed above, given the over-time approach of the GAMM and the importance of intonation for this method, we were surprised not to have a factor for which syllable of the noun the stress falls on.",Covered by answers to the previous two questions.,"Errors and speaker JW_3: We were surprised to see that this analysis does not exclude the productions that were marked in the Textgrid as containing errors.  While some productions labeled as errors contained errors only in some other part of the sentence and may have been usable, others contained mispronunciations or large pauses or self-corrections during the adjective and noun, influencing the f0 and duration of the target word(s).  In particular, we noticed on further examination of this analysis that only one token has ID data above ID 92: a token of Zitrone by speaker JW_3 that was labeled as an error.  This particular token has a large hesitation at the start of the noun, which the automatic labeling process probably included as part of the duration of the noun, pushing the entire actual intonation contour into higher ID numbers.  Furthermore, we noticed that speaker JW_3 has an extremely high proportion of their tokens labeled as errors, suggesting this speaker had difficulty with the task and should perhaps be excluded entirely.  Since there is so little data at high ID numbers, any effect toward the end of the GAMM curve could be unduly influenced by a few error tokens that include hesitations in the noun.

Creaky voice: We noticed large amounts of creak, especially at the ends of nouns (especially between schwa and vowel-initial ablegen), and for some speakers throughout large parts of the determiner, adjective, and noun.  We believe creak should have been either excluded from the GAMM analysis or analyzed as a separate dependent variable (presence/absence of creak).  So many productions end in creak that it would likely be impossible to exclude all productions that contain creak.  The automatically extracted pitch track is highly likely to have problems with creak.","This analysis transformed f0 to semitones.  We think this is fine, although with the Speaker random effect included, we’re not completely sure it’s necessary.","Visual presentation of results:  As we worked to understand what the GAMM coefficient results meant, we wished for some graphs, for example of fitted the GAMM over ID for each Typicality condition, and perhaps also a graph of average semitones over ID for each Typicality condition as well, to see how the GAMM fit the raw data.  Because of the way the GAMM fits the entire curve over the span of the nouns, it was difficult to interpret the overall finding that Medium and Typical both have significantly positive coefficients relative to Atypical across the time span of the GAMM, at some time.  To explore this, we did some additional graphing using the authors’ uploaded materials, and obtained this estimate of the difference between the fitted GAMM for Atypical vs. Medium, the larger of the two differences:
(Graph will not paste in)
Interpretation of final result: The graph suggests that the difference is based almost entirely on very high ID numbers, which as discussed above come from only a few tokens that are not well distributed across conditions and at least sometimes represent errors.  Furthermore, high ID numbers are the most likely to fall during creak.",1
petauroides_fistulator,50,85,70,publishable with minor revision.,"Regarding the phonetic analysis: according to the instructions provided by the project creators, the WORD tiers were not aligned with each German word. However, it is not clear from the authors’ write-up whether they aligned the WORD-level boundaries prior to extracting the words and saving them as separate files. This has the potential to greatly affect the outcome of the results (if, in fact, the F0 trajectories are NOT from the Nouns, but other words in the utterance).  
","This seems reasonable to us; as F0 varies over time, it makes sense to model with GAMMs.",The choice to include all of the variables from the spreadsheet in the model is not clearly motivated.,Why were the distractor names and colors included? We are not clear on the authors' motivations.,"As researchers who are marginally familiar with the GAMM analysis, we have some questions. First, why not use “typicality” as a by-variable smooth term, since it is the variable of interest? Additionally, why were all the other variables included as random smooths, rather than parametric terms?  
Overall, we would have benefited from more detail about the setup of the model and motivations for the specific selections made by the authors.","No data were excluded, according to this write-up. No mention was made of false starts, hesitations, or other errors that were enumerated in the textgrids, which we find to be an oversight that may have affected the outcome.","The authors transformed the F0 measurements into semitones, essentially normalizing by speaker to account for inherent vocal tract size differences. We find this to be an appropriate way to account for these differences.",NA,2
petauroides_fistulator,10,0,0,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"Our ratings reflect two main issues we found with this analysis. The first issue is the choice to analyse the F0 patterns of the nouns, which is reflected in the rating for the phonetic analysis. Target nouns are mutually exclusive across typicality conditions. As they comprise a range of number of syllables and different placements of stressed syllables, we were not convinced that their F0 patterns were comparable, both within and across typicality conditions, without a more nuanced consideration of these factors. The second issue is the implementation of GAMMs in this analysis, which we consider to be deeply flawed, for reasons explained below. Taken together, we did not find this analysis to be reliable for the current research question.",We consider the use of GAMMs to be appropriate for analysing F0 dynamics.,"The choice to consider intonation (and consequently F0) is theoretically sound, although we would be interested to learn about the process of deciding on intonation specifically, rather than, say, prosody more generally. The maximal approach to predictor inclusion is one of the established approaches in model fitting, but we have concerns about the role of each included predictor in the model (explained in Q12 and Q13). GAM checks were performed, but only the basis dimension checking results were reported. A cursory examination of the residual plots suggests that some transformation or data exclusion might have been required, and we would have liked to see more consideration of these.","Of all the variables included, we are in particular concerned with the suitability of ID, which we elaborate in Q13.","We are of the opinion that the model structure was problematic for a number of reasons. Modelling typicality as a parametric term rather than smooths (e.g. s(id, by = typicality)) meant that any non-linear shape differences in the F0 trajectories across typicality conditions were not modelled. The characteristics of the nouns in different conditions as explained in Q9 further compounded this issue. We raise a similar question for the inclusion of random effects – especially target name – as s(bs = ‘re’) terms in the model, as shape differences were again left out. Fitting F0 over ID instead of normalised time, when (word duration and) the number of data points per trial was not uniform, was also problematic. As the number of data points varied greatly even for the same words, the same ID would correspond to different parts of the word. Furthermore, the model was impacted by a small number of outliers with extremely high duration, which meant that a majority portion of the fitted curves had no meaningful reading for most tokens. The result is that the curves in the final model were simply not a meaningful or fit-for-purpose representation of the data.","We consider the choice to include only trials in the NF condition to be appropriate. We were not aware of any further exclusions being discussed, but we are curious what considerations the authors gave to any potential mismeasurements or to trials marked (e.g.) ‘error’.","We consider the conversion of F0 measurements from Hz to semitones to be appropriate. As mentioned in Q13, we believe that ID should have been transformed to normalised time (e.g. from 0 to 1).",N/A,0

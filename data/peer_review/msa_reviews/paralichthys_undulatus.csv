paralichthys_undulatus,75,60,55,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,The author(s) didn't control for word length and there were no interactions or slopes in their model. They treated the word types as independent in the analysis which means there's nothing in the model that links the adjectives to the noun.,We believe LMER is appropriate for this analysis.,We found the choice of variables suprising as there was nothing in the model that links the adjectives to the noun.,"The choice of investigating semitones within the word as opposed the relationship between adjective and noun was surprising. This method could be justified; however, it is hard to assess this based on the information provided.",There were no slopes or interactions in the model.,"We believe subsetting the data for the NF condition only was appropriate. While hesitations and pauses were removed, the lack of further outlier removal was inappropriate.",There were no transformations with the data.,"The report and code was straightforward and easy to tunderstand. However, it seemed as though the author(s) did not understand the way the typicality rankings were based on the relationship between the noun and adjective, and treated the typicality rankings as applying separately to both words and adjectives (for example, rather than ""blue banana"" being given an ""atypical"" rank, and ""yellow banana"" a ""typical"" rank, the author(s) analysis gave all instances of ""blue"" an ""atypical"" rank, all instances of ""yellow"" a ""typical"" rank, and ranked some instanes of ""banana"" as ""atypical"" and others as ""typical"" without reference to the adjective.",0
paralichthys_undulatus,50,50,50,publishable with major revision.,"Very little information is provided about any aspect of the analysis, so it is difficult to understand and assess exactly what was done, and why.","Linear Mixed Effects models are suitable, but because no hypotheses was proposed or motivated, the NHST does not seem to be an appropriate framework. Bayesian Mixed Models might have been a better approach, given the exploratory nature of much of the analysis.",No information is provided about the process by which the final model was chosen and no motivation is provided for the model structure used.,"The variables included in the model are appropriate for the exploration of influences on pitch range, assuming the data are sufficiently normally distributed, but no details are provided about how the final model was chosen or the suitability of the data.",The model seems appropriate for examining the interactions between F0 range and key factors in the dataset.,"The use of the NF (Noun Focus) condition only, excluding errors and hesitations, is appropriate.","The use semitone scaling for F0 is appropriate for fundamental frequency analysis, but no explanation is provided for why 100Hz was chosen as the reference frequency, or how this was motivated by the data.","This team have analyzed fundamental frequency in the Noun-Focused utterances to examine the effect of Typicality on F0 range. A single linear mixed effects model is presented and analyzed in a NHST framework, and the team report that ""we cannot conclude that speakers modify the f0 range of an utterance with an atypical versus typical referent"", but no specific hypotheses is outlined and the choice of model and variables is not motivated. No analyses are presented to validate the suitability of the data for the model chosen. The data were ""manually aligned based on visual and auditory inspection"", but no details are provided about how the segmentation was conducted, which landmarks were used, and how the data were validated.

F0 range is a key phonetic parameter which is certainly of interest in this dataset, and if it is the case that Typicality does not affect overal pitch excursion, that will be an important contribution to our understanding how how speakers modulate (or don't modulate) utterances of this type, but unfortunately, not enough information is provided to properly understand the details of the phonetic analysis, and the statistical results cannot be properly interpreted in the absence of a clear hypotheses and better motivated models.

paralichthys_undulatus,80,20,50,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"The analysis does not present any motivation, expectations or hypothesis. 
It is not explained, why only the noun focus condition was analyzed.

The dependent variable ""RangeST"" was not motivated (it might be naively understandable, nevertheless, I would have expected a broader analysis in terms of mean F0).

Also, given that there are systematic differences between speakers, absolute changes may not be representative. Instead, I would have recommended changes in standard deviations. I at least would have expected that speaker differences in F0 would be discussed. 

No discussion was provided how the automatic extraction of F0 was checked or how gender differences were accounted for (the algorithm provided by Praat yields sometimes octave errors when parameters are set incorrectly).

In the light of the model structure, the analyst seems to assume that there are only main effects of the predictors. However, it is possible that typicallity may attack only either the adjective or the noun, or that the effects may be different on these both classes. This type of effect should have been tested by an interaction between word class and typicality (or at least reported that it had been tested). 

In the manuscript, the reader is pointed to the results in the tables and the figures. But no in deepth discussion is provided. 

No discussion of distributions is provided. In Figure 1, one can infer that F0 is not normally distributed. I would have liked to see a density plot for both classes (and typicalities). 

Also, Figure 2 is not discussed. While the results of the statistical analysis are summarized, the mean values in Table 3 are not discussed at all (simply presented on the platter for the reader to analyze them). 

No variables were tested to control for typical changes of F0 such as word duration phonetic context, speaking rate, etc.). 



",The statistical analysis is OK under the assumption that the distribution of the dependent variable is normal (which it seems not to be).,"The analyst chose the most obvious predictors: word class and typicality, in addition to standard random effects. 
The dependent variable was not motivated. 
The structure of the model is flawed or at least not properly discussed, as I have outlined above.","The predictors are suitable for the analysis. 
The dependent variable seems to be not normally distributed, which may introduce problems in the evaluation of the model.",The structure of the model is suitable to test the underlying question.,The analyst has not discussed the exclusion of the other conditions provided by the project.,No transformations of the data have been performed.,"In my opinion, the analyst has done the bare minimum to analyze the data, both in terms of the analysis as well as reportage.",0

trachurus_riukiuensis,50,95,70,publishable with major revision.,"The authors should consider measuring only specific portions of the adjective (for instance, only the stressed vowel), instead of including the flanking consonants and any unstressed vowels (e.g. the plural morpheme -en) in the segmentation, as there is variation inherent in segmental duration that was not accounted for here. Re: peak F0 measure: Section 1.3 was confusing; we are not clear on the ""word"" from which the pitch measurements were derived (i.e. the adjective or the noun), complicating our critiques of the analysis of this acoustic measure.",This seems reasonable to us.,"The variable selection seems mostly on point. Our only critique was that ""color"" was not considered as a fixed effect, given that the vowels in each of the adjectives (and nouns) were different, and would likely contribute to variation in the duration measure.",See above,Suitable,We are concerned with the high number of exclusions for the F0 article model; 20% of the data excluded seems quite high.,"We were surprised that the F0 data were not transformed based on speaker sex (which, while albeit an imperfect strategy, is common in the field). Speaker sex was not provided with the data, so it would perhaps have been wiser to not include this measure at all (since arbitrarily determining speaker sex is also problematic).","While we are mostly satisfied with the segmentation criteria discussed, motivating those decisions via citations of other scholars' work would have strengthened their decisions and our confidence in their methods. We were also surprised to not see any discussion or summary of the analysis as a whole, nor a section specifically targeting the limitations of the analysis.",1
trachurus_riukiuensis,75,30,50,publishable with major revision.,"We found the segmentation protocol to be generally rigorous, although no result is provided (qualitative or quantitative) for the inter-segmenter reliability check. The Praat script used to obtain the phonetic measurements is not provided and, thus, could not be reviewed.

While the statistical analysis followed a generally accepted framework, there were issues with how models were formed, meaning that the resulting estimate of uncertainty is very likely inflated. Our rating for this part is thus a reflection of what we consider a flawed and somewhat misleading analysis that is likely to produce an unreliable estimate of the relationship between the variables.",We consider the use of linear mixed-effects modelling to be appropriate.,"We found the process of model selection to be generally appropriate. However, the widespread issues of model convergence and singular fits suggests that another approach (e.g. Bayesian regression) might have been more appropriate for the dataset used here.","Duration and peak f0 are certainly relevant variables to include, although we believe that they are too reductive for the research question. For example, only including peak f0 ignores dynamic prosody, which might be captured by including also minimum f0, f0 range, f0 slope, or some global quantification of the overall f0 contour. Also, no measures of intensity are included, which is surprising given that the team has specified that “the effect would manifest as a prosodic difference.”

We strongly disagree with the inclusion of  “noun” as random effect, for reasons outlined in Q13.","We are of the opinion that the final models were not appropriately structured. The inclusion of noun as a random effect is inappropriate for the research question: nouns are mutually exclusive over typicality conditions, thus including a random effect for noun effectively offsets the main effect of typicality. Indeed, using a by-adjective instead of by-noun random effect as a proxy for a by-item effect results in significant main effects for the two duration models.","We consider excluding trials marked with “error” or “hesitation break” to be an appropriate choice. The exclusion of all data from speaker JW_3 is perhaps questionable, but justified clearly in the text.

The method of outlier removal, while not common in the field, appears to be justified.","No transformations were performed. We believe that this is appropriate for f0 but inappropriate for duration, which should ideally be log-transformed before statistical treatment in a linear model.",Inclusion of the Praat script used for obtaining the phonetic measurements would have been appropriate.,1
trachurus_riukiuensis,70,85,80,publishable with minor revision.,"They chose two relevant acoustic measures (duration and f0) of the article, adjective and noun, they labelled and measured them accurately and used a relevant statistical method. I am not quite clear on their reason for examining the article, as well as only the stressed syllable of the noun - more motivation would be helpful.","They used linear mixed models on each measure, which is a valid approach for this type of data.","The dependent variables were duration and f0 peak - the only issue here is that the instructions were to only include one in the writeup. The independent variable was typicality. Each condition (article, adjective, noun) was examined in a separate model. As noted above, the choice to include the article was not clearly motivated.","Participant and item were random intercepts... random slopes would be more appropriate but led to convergence issues. In the noun, they only examined up to the stressed syllable - again, without a clearly stated motivation for this. While this logically makes sense in terms of pitch accents, this is not stated in the report.",Using a linear regression model for each of the acoustic variables is a valid approach to answer this research question.,"They excluded sentences that were marked as errors or hesitations, which makes sense. They also excluded one speaker JW_3 due to them having a high error rate - this seems unnecessary. They also excluded any values that were +/- 2.5 standard deviations from the mean, which is logical.","The f0 measures appear to have been left in Hertz, which is not clearly stated but there is no mention of transformation. Converting them to semitones would have been more appropriate since the participants were pooled.","They examined more than one acoustic measure, and it would have been appropriate to not use raw Hz for the f0 measures.",2
trachurus_riukiuensis,82,81,80,publishable with minor revision.,"Overall we thought this was a very solid analysis, but we thought there were potentially issues with Praat settings for f0 analysis (perhaps wider range needed for female speakers) and we questioned the removal of outliers.",Entirely appropriate,Entirely appropriate,Entirely appropriate,Entirely appropriate,The process involved removing outliers. The decision to remove outliers wasn't justified and we think that this issue is more to do with measurement methods rather than statistical outliers (i.e. an issue with data extraction).,"Perhaps the f0 could have been converted to a perceptual scale, but we thought the use of raw Hz was fine",NA,2

nestor_idahoensis,55,75,65,publishable with minor revision.,"Rating of phonetic analysis: no interpretation of F1 and F2 data is provided in the analysis, and isn't easily interpreted. Because different directions of effect (i.e., F1 should decrease with vowel space dispersion for high vowels and increase with vowel space dispersion for low vowels) are expected by vowel it's unclear how to interpret a main effect of typicality on F1 or F2. 
Rating of statistical analysis: The statistical analysis is largely sufficient; the authors wrote a clear analysis and description of their statistical methods. We're not sure whether including words (which is effectively vowel) as random slopes was appropriate, because the directions for the F1 and F2 variables vary predictably by vowel. We would have appreciated more justification for the choice of using random slopes for word effects rather than a fixed effect, and the implications for interpretation of the main effect of typicality on F1 and F2.",The Bayesian analysis was well-motivated.,"The independent variable addressed the research question. 
The dependent variables duration and F0 were appropriate. F1 and F2 were relevant, but required further interpretation as described above.",The variables were suitable to include in a model investigating the effect of typicality on prosodic realization.,"Given that word and vowel are identical features, including word as a random effect rather than a fixed effect made the results of the model difficult to interpret because of the different predictions for F1 and F2 by vowel.",The researchers made appropriate choices to exclude unlikely measurements from their analysis.,The researchers made appropriate choices to log transform data.,We acknowledge that our expertise is limited in evaluating the technical aspects of a Bayesian statistical model.,2
nestor_idahoensis,70,80,75,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis conducted was very detailed and thorough, I had a few recommendations but I would include this as a publishable code that should be shared with students.","The choice of statistical analysis was conducted well and was explained clearly, concisely and thoroughly.","The variables were driven by the literature, as opposed to including them as controls to purify the variable, allowing type I error to be reduced (Shears & Zumbo, 2013; Spector & Brannick, 2011;  Westfall & Yarkoni, 2016). However, in the future, it is recommended that the variables are centred and scaled.  The structure of statistical model was very clear, concise and provided enough researcher to reproduce the analysis.","The variables were driven by the literature, as opposed to including them as controls to purify the variable, allowing type I error to be reduced (Shears & Zumbo, 2013; Spector & Brannick, 2011;  Westfall & Yarkoni, 2016).

Much outlier exclusion or data removal is arbitrary, potentially leading to type I error.  However, if there was an explanation provided as to why this choice was conducted, it would allow the thinking to be more reproducible.","The choice to use raw data was adequate. However, there is a need to include statistical assumptions to check if the correct technique used. Bayesian is an approach that can apply to any statistical technique, but it is unclear if each assumption has been fulfilled.  If the residuals were not normally distributed, there is a need for transformation (e.g. log, inverse) to ensure the normal distribution was normally distributed.",NA,2
nestor_idahoensis,20,75,40,publishable with major revision.,"This analysis contained some appropriate methods, and we were impressed by the rigor of the data preparation and the clarity of the write-up. However, it was also subject to several serious flaws in the experimental design. Chiefly, the choice to collapse all vowels together in comparing F1 and F2 is not appropriate. Each vowel has its own set of formant properties, so for example, comparing F1 of /u/ and F1 of /i/ in a collapsed analysis muddles the data so much that no claim can be made about formant differences. Additionally, because the data set contains male and female speakers, collapsing their F0 measurements creates an additional set of problems related to the fact that they did not use any normalization methods. It is therefore unsurprising that none of their results were significant, because the data is so hypervariant as to be informative. As a result, it cannot be validly compared against typicality conditions.","The choice of statistical type was appropriate, and we appreciate their thoughtful choices with respect to data analysis. However, the strength of their statistics is somewhat undermined by the unusual choice of variables, which has the outcome of producing results that are not necessarily reliable. These limitations are discussed below.","First and foremost, a major and critical flaw in the model is that vowel identity was not included. Since vowels were not separated from one another, measures of F1/F2 will be so variant as to be meaningless in comparing F1/F2 values across typicality conditions. (To be clear, vowel identity must be included in the model so that the F1/F2 values of one vowel in one typicality condition are compared to only the F1/F2 values of that same vowel in another typicality condition.)

In addition, the authors do not provide extensive justification for their choice of variables; essentially they are just looking for differences in acoustic measures related to prominence between typicality conditions. They motivate this with the claim that prosodic stress can be used for pragmatic emphasis. This is uncontroversial, but they do not state the direction of their hypotheses for these variables, which is a major limitation. Do the authors expect longer duration, lower/higher F0 or lower/higher formant measures for stressed vowels in the atypical condition? If so, what motivates these hypotheses?
","The acoustic variables were well very much suitable for measuring acoustic effects of prominence, for a language like German. However, we are puzzled why the authors took measures only for adjective words (Sidenote: it ought to be mentioned in the write-up which words were considered “target words”, when the experimental condition had two target words), when the NF condition was selected. To be clear, it would seem to us that, in the NF condition, the *noun* would presumably be the item that is most prominent (thus subject to variability in degrees of prominence). In fact, since “typicality” is about the noun-adjective *combination*, it perhaps would have been even more appropriate to run the model on measures from *both* the noun and adjective (due to the nature of what defines typicality, in this experimental context).","The choice of a Bayesian mixed effects model was appropriate, though it would have been useful to have more information about their “weakly informative priors”. The model included their variables of interest, but was limited by the fact that the F0 and formant data was not normalized for important speaker characteristics (especially gender) which should have been included.","The authors excluded segments of forced-aligned intervals shorter than 50 ms, however they did not report how many such vowels were excluded.","We think the authors should have normalized the F1 and F2 measures of speakers, in order to use data from various genders and body types (both known to influence formant values) to analyze the effect of condition on F1/F2. Similarly, f0 also ought to have been normalized (e.g., as a z-score according to speaker) to run measures on data that come from a variety of speakers.","There is a lot of good work here, but there are *only two* critical (and straightforward!) changes that must be made for the results to be meaningful: the normalization of F1/F2/f0 measures for each speaker, and the inclusion of vowel identity in the model. (In addition, the authors are strongly encouraged to revisit the direction of effects in their hypotheses and to be explicit about what motivates these hypotheses.)",1
nestor_idahoensis,94,83,87,publishable with minor revision.,"Both the phonetic and statistical analysis are competently executed, though I have some minor concerns about the latter (specifically about prior specifications & multivariate modelling).","The authors fitted a Bayesian multivariate lognormal mixed regression model to the data; this seems appropriate, but I should note that the fact that this is a multivariate model is not mentioned anywhere in the report, which is problematic! It is also not made clear how a multivariate model is more appropriate here than separate univariate models for each of the outcomes. (I'm not arguing that it isn't – but there should be some discussion / contextualisation in the text).","There were clear a priori reasons for picking each outcome variable, and the predictors are straightforward. There are perhaps slightly too many outcome variables that are evaluated, though the authors' arguments for including all of them are compelling.",The variables are suitable for addressing the main research questions.,"I have some concerns about the prior specifications for the models: namely, this is a multivariate model, and each outcome variable is on a very different scale; but the priors are the same (SD=10). I don't think that such a prior works well for e.g. F2 values, where differences of 50-100 Hz are not at all surprising; and it seems overly permissive for duration values that are represented in seconds. The RMarkdown file seems to include a sensitivity analysis, but this is not clearly described in the report.

Also, the lognormal distributional assumption may not hold for some of the outcomes!","Any choices to exclude data were grounded in strong a priori argumentation, so no issues here.",There were no data transformations.,NA,2

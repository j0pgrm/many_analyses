pervagor_meeki,75,65,70,publishable with minor revision.,"f0 extraction could be more fine tuned, the team priviledged one measure per word, separate mixed effects models were run each having a different dependend variable: ANOVAS with repeated measures would have been sufficiant for this type of analyses. A more complex model combining the different measures would have been interesting.",en vogue but the data was not complex enough to justify this type of analysis.,"ok, four dependend variables were analyzed according to typicality with random effects that differed between nouns and adjectives. A total of 8 models were run.","fine, but leading to eight separate models",fine,portions of the signal containing comments in the TG were excluded: valid option,f0 was transformed to semi-tones a LOGARITHMIC scale,NA,2
pervagor_meeki,80,80,80,publishable with minor revision.,"We question the decision to slow down the one speaker's rate of speech and wonder what the criteria was that went behind that decision. Specifically, why it was slowed down by a factor of 1.5",We agree that a series of linear mixed effects models are a good choice for this data set.,"The variables (duration, pitch, intensity) answer the question that was posed in the project.","We question the use of duration of the whole word, especially in the nouns, as the nouns used are not present in every typicality condition, and are very different in length. Additionally, typicality was used as a categorical variable instead of a continuous one, which might have yielded different results.",The structure of the model is suitable for the data set. The authors are aware of their analyses's limitations with regard to including word as a random effect.,"The authors marked sentences for speech error and noise or hesitation and excluded them from the analysis. We wonder why the ""fast speaker"" was slowed down instead of just excluded as other data were.","As mentioned above, we would like a more detailed reasoning or criteria for slowing down the rate of one of the speakers by a factor of 1.5.",N/A,2
pervagor_meeki,90,90,90,publishable with minor revision.,"There are only minor flaws in both the phonetic and statistical analysis of this study. Even though some of the changes we propose in this review might affect the overall outcome of the analysis, they are mostly suggestions and not obligatory.",Linear Mixed Effect Regressions (using the latest versions of standard R packages) are an appropriate statistical analysis for the derived acoustic data and chosen variables. Computing effect sizes with estimated marginal means is also fine.,"The process only included small changes to the originally planned analyses, both of which are reasonable: the exclusion of by-word random slopes for the LMERs on nouns because word did not vary with typicality (but see answer below: excluding a random intercept by word is not justified); and a comparison of the NF and AF conditions which was impossible because in AF the nouns were not balanced across the typicality conditions.","The acoustic variables – mean and max F0, mean intensity, and duration – are reasonable choices because these can be acoustic correlates of prosodic prominence.","In the LMERs for nouns, “word” was completely excluded from the random effects. Since word did not vary with typicality, it makes sense to have no by-word slope for typicality, but there should have been a random intercept for word, given that these words are phonetically very diverse. Using the provided scripts and datasets, we computed the LMER on mean F0 in nouns, but included a random intercept for word. The results were not significant for all three pairwise comparisons, showing that the intercept for word could have a major impact on the outcome of the other statistical results as well.
Otherwise, the structure of the LMERs seems to have been carefully chosen and is well explained in the report.","Only NF was analysed and sentences with speech errors, hesitations, etc. were excluded. Both of these choices are justified, although with more time and some manual work one could have saved some of the excluded sentences probably.
Both nouns and adjectives of the NF condition were analysed. While it is somewhat unclear (though not entirely inconceivable) why effects of typicality should show up in the adjectives when the noun is focused, the analysis of the adjectives is nevertheless interesting because it can (and does) show that typicality is mostly not expressed prosodically in the adjectives.
The acoustic measurements were extracted for whole words, not just for e.g. stressed vowels. There seem to be precedents for whole-word-analyses, but it would have been interesting from our perspective to constrain the analysis to stressed vowels only given that prosodic effects will likely show up in the stressed vowels rather than somewhere else within the words.
Outliers, i.e. data points exceeding three standard deviations from each speaker’s mean, were excluded which is reasonable.","F0 was transformed into semitones, a choice that is not explained in much detail but should be fine. More questionable is the use of fundamental frequency values that do not account for differences between males and females; the speakers’ sex could have therefore impacted the statistical analysis without having been taken into account by e.g. adding sex as a fixed effect.
One speaker’s sound file and the corresponding TextGrid were slowed down by a factor of 1.5, but it remains unclear why 1.5 was chosen and which possible acoustic effects the slowing down of the sound file had (e.g. overall lowering of F0?). It was unclear whether the artificially slowed down audio files were also used to extract F0, or whether these were only used for duration measurements.
More generally, the extracted duration values were not normalised in any way, neither for individual speaking rate nor for length of word. The latter would have been especially necessary, because the target nouns consist of between two and four syllables. Therefore, word type is a confounding factor in the analysis of duration.",The report was well written and easy to follow.,2
pervagor_meeki,97,88,92,publishable with minor revision.,The authors conducted a proper acoustic analysis with minor inaccuracies in the statistical models.,"Linear mixed-effects models are a good choice for this type of analysis.
","Because of singular fit the authors applied different random effect structures (intercepts or slopes) for the same dependent variables for nouns and adjectives. This inconsistency doesn’t allow comparing results.

The authors predict acoustic cues’ values based on the typicality rating, but we believe that it should be the other way around: we need to find how acoustic cues affect typicality.","Raw intensity and duration of words might have distorted the results, some normalization procedure should have been performed.
Gender was not included into the statistical models.
The authors did not take into account the fact that in the experiment each stimulus was produced twice, so the observations were not independent which is a violation of regression model requirements.",Overall we think that model structures are reasonable.,"The authors excluded all ‘problematic’ tokens with background noise, hesitations, errors etc. We think that since they were looking for acoustic parameters of nouns, this approach is correct.","The authors used Montreal Forced Aligner for annotation of the sounds. Since they manually checked the results, we suppose that it was correct.
Raw acoustic data (intensity and duration) was not normalized by speaker, which makes observations hardly comparable.",NA,2

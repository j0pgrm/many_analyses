neosilurus_omanensis,90,90,90,publishable as is.,"Audio and text-grids were automatically force-aligned using software for this purpose, and a part of this alignment was double-checked by human annotators. Automated force-alignment needed to be used anyway due to time and financial constraints. Human-annotated data was used when available, and the remaining data used came from the automatic force-alignment. Four pitch-related variables were used (pitch ratio of the adjective, pitch range ratio of the adjective, pitch variation ratio within the adjective, pitch change ratio within the adjective) as well as speech ratio. Using five acoustic cues certainly enriches the analysis, though we understood that only one dependent variable should have been used.","Linear regression models were appropriately used for the analysis. For each dependent variable (there were 5, see comment on previous and next questions) two models were fitted, one with 'typicality' as an independent variable, and another adding 'context' and an interaction between typicality and context. Models were compared and the more complex model was used only if it added significant information. Analysts included varying terms for participant and adjective when the model converged, and dropped them when convergion was an issue, but did not mention if only varying intercepts or also varying slopes were included. When varying terms were dropped, they did mention which one(s) ended up being dropped.
Statistical analysis was appropriate. Analysts made sensible adjustments to p-value interpretation (raising alpha for the one-tailed interpretation, but also correcting p-values for multiple comparisons). They also calculated effect sizes, which were in general very small (though analysts did not comment much about them). All information provided by the models (beta coefficients, p-values and effect sizes) led to the conclusion of no effect of typicality.","A total of ten models were fitted, and five were reported, since five dependent variables were used for the analysis (4 related to pitch and 1 to speech rate). Correction for multiple comparisons was done. This is very informative for the analysis, though we understood that  each team should have selected only one dependent variable and therefore only one statistical model to be reported. The dependent variables were:
1) Pitch ratio of the adjective
2) Pitch range ratio of the adjective 
3) Pitch variation ratio within the adjective
4) Pitch change ratio within the adjective
5) Speech rate (articulation rate) of the adjective","Procedures for including/excluding variables, which have already been commented on, were appropriate.","The structure of the statistical models was suitable, as already commented on.","Speech rate outliers of more than two standard deviations from the participantâ€™s mean were deleted. Also, for both adjective and sentence, the pitch minimum and maximum and the pitch range of the first 10% and last 10% were deleted if they exceeded the range of the mean plus/minus two standard deviations. The amount of deleted values was considerable, especially for maxima and minima, which affected the analysis of pitch range and pitch rise, but since the remaining data were still balanced, they were used.",There was no data transformation.,NA,3
neosilurus_omanensis,95,95,95,publishable with minor revision.,The team needs to elaborate clearly on the outliers issue. The criteria of deleting the outliers was not clear enough for readers. Is every false response or error an outlier?,The two models are good. But the authors have to clarify the reason behind the effect size's formula used in their analysis.,Very good.,The authors need to clarify the differences between errors found in the original data and the outliers.,Very good.,Good,Good,NA,2

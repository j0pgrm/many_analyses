procambarus_maculosus,79,31,52,publishable with major revision.,"The team chose F0 of the stressed vowel in nouns as the basis for their statistical model. We’d like to point to the following issues of this approach:
- By analyzing nouns instead of adjectives the researchers seemed to do the opposite thing from what was supposed by the organizers.
- There are few minimal pairs with the same vowel qualities to compare: walnuss (typical) - paprika (atypical); bohnen, zitrone (typical) - aprikose (medium). However, all the data was inserted into the statistical model.
- Automatic F0 extraction did not always work well, but such tokens weren’t excluded or analyzed manually.
- It’s not clear why the team opted for making a FPCA and then plug its results as inputs of a mixed effects regression. They could’ve just made a regression which tries to predict F0 on the basis of independent variables.
- Trying to predict FPCA components instead of typicality makes the analysis obscure and makes it hard to get back to raw data.",The application of FPCA is not well reasoned. It’s not clear why the team opted for this type of analysis and then used its results as inputs of a mixed effects regression.,The choice of mixed-effects is not clear. The model looks like this: component ∼ typicality ∗ gender + (gender | word) + (typicality | speaker). We can’t understand why related variables of speaker and gender can be both random intercepts and random slopes.,We wanted to note that analyzing Gender (even though the organizers did not provide this data) was reasonable.,Leaving aside the problems with certain variables in mixed effects the structure of the model is reasonable. However the choice of the predicted variable (FPCA components) does not correspond to the initial goal.,"F0 values were extracted automatically. In case F0 data was not available at some point within a vowel, the team decided to use the closest available F0 value. We don’t know how many tokens had this problem, but we think they should’ve been excluded or F0 values should have been extracted for them in a semi-automatic mode.
We agree that tokens with background noise or meaningful errors should have been excluded. The researchers did this.",We think that FPCA transformation of the data and making its result the main predicted variable in the statistical analysis is not justified by the researchers.,"It’s really strange that this peer review questionnaire does not pose any questions as to whether the analysis makes linguistic sense. What we are reviewing are, basically, the tools used, but not whether the results are reasonable.",1
procambarus_maculosus,88,92,90,publishable with minor revision.,"The report is extremely well and clearly written.

It answers the research question.

It offers an adequate phonetic analysis. 

The choice and the execution of the statistical analysis largely support the phonetic analysis and the overall goal of the study.","The authors decided to analyze the data by submitting the data points to Functional Principal Component  Analysis (FCPA). The authors carry out a Linear Mixed Effect Regression (LMER) analysis of the received principal components. The LME models developed are well-formed and properly  motivated given the data structure.

The only problematic part of selecting the LME model out of the models received by using the backward elimination was that the models were not actually compared by using the anova() function in R. The authors trusted the step() function in R without checking the fit of each model against each other.","The authors decided to submit the timely-normalized F0 data points to FCPA. 
The received PC1 and PC2 were made dependent variables, while the typicality and sex were the independent variables. The two models also had by-speaker and by-word effects included in the models. 

The variables were very well suited for the LME models as the models support the type of exploration the authors intended to carry out.","The variables fit the models extremely well. First, the typicality is the variable whose effect upon the principal component the authors wanted to investigate and therefore it was an independent variable. In addition, it is well known that the speaker’s sex influences the F0 levels, so the two (typicality and sex) were the two independent variables explored. 
",The statistical models were very well structured and executed.,"All the choices to exclude or not exclude certain subsets of data were well motivated.

First, the authors excluded 2 files because of the error in the pronunciation of the target item and the loud noise. 
Second, the authors excluded all the ANF and AF trials. The authors did not explain why they excluded these trials, but we understand that there was an unequal number of tokens in each condition.The authors excluded the adjectives in the NF trials from the analysis because they expected the greatest F0 modulations in the nouns per typicality.
Third, the authors excluded the items with fewer than 5 F0 data points after the MAUS segmentation, which yielded a sufficient number of data points for  the analysis.
","All the F0s were timed normalized. F0 normalization is a standard procedure in many acoustic analyses, so in general the authors’ decisions on the transformation of the data was on target.","Very succinct and precise analysis corroborated with previous research.
Excellently written report, well-formed statistical analysis and well-motivated phonetic
analysis.

The study was not anonymized! 

Certain parts of the analysis were not sufficiently described or even not thoroughly carried out, such as the FPCA, and the pruning of the models.

The authors could have explained why they did not include in their phonetic analysis other acoustic properties such as duration and intensity.",2
procambarus_maculosus,25,35,30,publishable with major revision.,"The fPCA and related analysis seems to be well implemented, and the authors ‘reverse engineer’ the fPCA results for interpretation fairly clearly. However, the results are likely to be misleading (in our view) due to the problematic choice of measurement domain (see below).","LMER on the results of fPCA is a good/appropriate approach, and has been carefully implemented and clearly explained. The choice of variables/domains seems to ‘miss the point’ for us, however.","We do not understand i) why only f0 was measured and, for f0, ii) why f0 measurements were taken in the noun in each adjective-noun combination, rather than in the adjective. 

Prosodic prominence has a range of phonetic exponents, and other measures could have been taken, e.g. duration. Since f0 is measured on a time-normalised basis the analysis sets aside possible effects of typicality on duration completely, which is a potential gap. 

The choice to measure in the noun is not really explained; the authors say that it is in the noun that they “expect the largest possible f0 differences”, but do not say why they expect this.  The choice to measure in the stressed vowel only is appropriate, though even in the adjectives the syllable structure varied, making the stressed rhyme a better domain to use.","The model only looked for effects of typicality and speaker sex, and finds an effect of sex only (based on estimated sex for each speaker). Inter-speaker variation in f0 range (a large part of which will co-vary with sex) could be controlled for by normalising the f0 values for each token by a baseline measure for that speaker (e.g. mean of all min f0 values in all tokens) prior to performing the fPCA. The eventual model could then look at e.g. typicality * vowel.   

The model does not control for vowel quality and length, despite the acknowledged variation in segmental content across nouns; this would have been fairly simple to include.
",Inclusion of a random slope for speakers by typicality is appropriate.,"The authors analysed the NF subset of the data, which was the test portion, so is appropriate. They manually corrected the transcripts for any hesitation or other errors which did not affect the test word (= noun, in their analysis) and excluded two cases where the target noun was mispronounced. This was a good approach if working on the nouns; you would need to exclude tokens where the adjective was mispronounced if the analysis focussed on adjectives.","No transformations were applied, other than time-normalisation of the f0 contour.","In a review we might offer a major revision/revise and resubmit because there might be something here if they were to re-run the same analysis on the adjectives; they could normalise f0 within each speaker’s pitch range to abstract away effect of sex on f0, instead of estimating it based on auditory impression.",1
procambarus_maculosus,75,75,75,publishable with minor revision.,"I appreciate the originality of the analysis. While the research question was simple, analyzing F0 offers many possible approaches to do it. I was unfamiliar with this approach and am interested in learning more. There were some decisions that I would ask for more information about. For example, the decision to substitute missing F0 values within the vowel with the value at the previous timepoint. It seems this could really affect the measures, and there may be better methods to avoid pitch halving or doubling artifacts (such as resetting the threshold values for a speaker).",The multi-level model used seems appropriate for the question.,"I think choosing the primary components for the f0 contour rather than raw values was an interesting choice. I am unfamiliar with this type of analysis, although my impression is that it seems promising. To me, it is the part of the analysis that stands out the most. The statistical technique itself is fairly simple, but is appropriate given the question; that said, I'm not sure why the pruning was carried out, rather than report on the initial model including things that were apparently not significant.",The included and excluded variables seem well-justified. One aspect of this that I would like more information on is on how the cutoff gets decided for deciding what principal components to include/exclude.,The overall structure of the statistical model was suitable.,Exclusion decisions are well-justified and suitable.,"The major transformation in the project involves the conversion from F0 measures to principal components. I am somewhat unfamiliar with this approach, although the authors do a good job at explaining the process briefly.",NA,2

cromileptes_saxatilis,90,85,87,publishable with minor revision.,"Overall, the report is very well-written with clear documentation of all the steps and accompanying codes. 
The only information that I find a little hard to find is what exactly is included in the 'notes' tier. This report would benefit from making this clear since the data exclusion is dependent on this information. There are some descriptions of what 'error' is but not other types. 

The statistical models were also well presented. However, I would like to play devil's advocate and express the concerns for people who are not completely familiar with or convinced by bayesian methods, since it is still a relatively new statistical procedure for the field. My biggest concern is how the priors were chosen, and how different priors could lead to different results. For instance, the min, max, and mean duration were all taken from the current data. Is this the norm? Are the current data representative enough as 'average segment duration'? How to include previously published literature on segment duration? What would be the consequence if another person uses a different value, say setting the minimum as 0.1 and maximum as 1.2? I understand the authors have included references which may have the answers for all these questions. However, I think as for now, it is better to include explanations and interpretations in all reports which use Bayesian method until it is more widely understood in the field. I am by no means against using this method, but my suggestion is for the authors to include more explanations.",Good attempt but needs more explanation.,"To the best of my knowledge, the process is good.",The variables selected were suitable for the research question the authors presented.,It is suitable.,"As I previously mentioned, the 'notes' tier needs a bit more detailed description. Having examined the codes and data frame, I think the data exclusion procedures in this report were justified.",n/a,NA,2
cromileptes_saxatilis,100,75,88,publishable as is.,"The analysis is well done and well explained, the methods are appropriate considering data and research question. However, it is not well argued why only the typical and atypical conditions were compared as opposed to all three conditions.",The choice of Bayesian mixed effects lognormal regression seems appropriate based on my research into the model.,"The fact that adjective duration was chosen as the main dependent variable was backed up by other literature, and thus seemed reasonable. The other variables (speaker, utterance, degree of typicality) were more or less given by the research question and the way the data was set up.","All included variables are suitable for the model, as already mentioned, I don't understand why medium typical combinations were not included.",Since I have never used the model myself (or have much knowledge of Bayesian statistics) I cannot rate the structure of the model.,"As far as I can tell, including medium typical combinations would not have made the model more difficult to interpret and thus I do not really understand why they were excluded. 
Exclusion of utterances marked as erroneous, as well as missing data points based on  the duration extraction method seems reasonable. 
Why the conditions other than the target condition (noun focus) were included was not explained.","no obvious data transformation was done (at least none that was described), but since only one dependent variable was analyzed, I wouldn't expect much data transformation",I really liked seeing an analysis that focused mainly on one dependent variable instead of a multifactoral approach.,3
cromileptes_saxatilis,80,80,80,publishable with minor revision.,"The focus on a single parameter (i.e. duration) enhances the overall legibility of the study. The hypothesis (which is eventually not supported by statistical analysis) is justified by evidence from the literature that predictability is negatively correlated with duration. While opting for parsimony (and duration) is a legitimate choice, we feel that perhaps the motivation for this should be supported by more references. Ditto for the authors’ choice to “minimise researcher degrees of freedom”: since this is the driving principle behind their workflow, a reference allowing readers to get a clearer idea of what this entails would be welcome. The report is very clear, with just enough detail to allow other researchers to reproduce the analysis pipeline. Only adjective and noun pairs from the NF condition were analyzed. The Praat and R Markdown scripts are provided. A potential issue with the Praat scripts is that: 1) they were written with the old Praat syntax (3 dots after function names, single quotes for variable substitution, etc.) – which, of course, is not problematic per se, as Praat still accepts it, but it may look a little opaque to younger Praat scripters and, 2) there are no comments in the Praat scripts (the RMd file has some, by definition). Perhaps “where there was a pause between the adjective and the noun” should be clarified: what counted as a pause here? “no apparent anomalies or obvious outliers”: a well-established method like boxplot inspection would sound more convincing. “orangen, which was typically pronounced with a fricative”: this is a little confusing since it implies that there’s something wrong with what the native speakers in the experiment produced. The explanation (that the German dictionary for the aligner only has a velar nasal and no fricative) actually appears in the R Markdown file but maybe it would be clearer to mention this in the report (or leave out this detail altogether).","The authors used a Bayesian mixed effects lognormal regression model, and justified their choice as follows: “lognormal distribution with a log link function is used to better approximate the distribution of the duration data”. To the best of our knowledge, this is appropriate.",The structure of the model looks valid : adj_dur ~ typicality + (1 | speaker) + (1 | target_noun) + (1 + typicality | target_adjective). It is said that an additional random slope ((1 + typicality | speaker)) was added but removed due to convergence issues. The choice of priors is thoroughly explained. Perhaps a reference for the whole methodology should be given since we expect that many potential readers are not specialists of Bayesian models and how priors should be chosen.,"The structure is suitable but it should be noted that the authors only kept two levels of the typicality factor: atypical vs typical, thus leaving out the medium modality. The justification for this is “simpler and more easily interpretable models with fewer parameters; and these two groups are where the most pronounced difference is expected”. This of course makes perfect sense, but it would probably be more appropriate (for the sake of scientific transparency, and the possibility to perform post hoc pairwise comparisons) to include all three levels of “typicality” in the analysis.",The structure is appropriate.,"As mentioned in previously: the exclusion of the “medium” level of the “typicality” factor, while pragmatically justified, is perhaps questionable","The intrinsically skewed duration data is not explicitly converted to log values but the use of a log link function implies that the model works in log space under the hood. So the authors reasoned both in terms of log and raw duration values to build their model, but the output is shown in raw duration (seconds), which is desirable since it is more interpretable.",NA,2
cromileptes_saxatilis,75,95,89,publishable with minor revision.,"We find this report very easy to follow, very transparent, and well-motivated! We appreciate the clarity, the motivation behind the choice of the phonetic analyses, the statistical analysis, and the sobriety in the interpretation of the findings. Team cromileptes_saxat are asking a clear and relevant question with a fitting measurement and sound procedures. However, the approach might be too minimalistic, since it leaves some other variables of potential interest (i.e. beyond adjective duration) unexplored. Also, conclusions would be strengthened by further consideration of non-linguistic effects (e.g.. to rule out learning or fatigue effects) and/or the cause of the divergence issue in the modelling process. Therefore, we recommend ‘minor revisions’, as the analysis is not quite perfect.  
","The authors performed a Bayesian mixed-effects lognormal regression, which is a well-justified state of the art statistical approach. Priors and random effects structure were reasonable. For model convergence issues with random slopes over typicality by speaker, the maximal tree depth was additionally tried to be adapted, up to a value which was not necessarily useful. Additionally, using more sampling in the warmup phase might have helped to additionally deal with the divergence issues.  
","The model includes typicality (treatment coded with two levels), random intercepts by speaker and by target noun, and random intercepts and slopes over typicality by target adjective. Additional random slope over typicality by speaker was also considered to be included in the model, but rejected due to divergent transitions. We do not expect these slopes to play a meaningful role, but further exploration of the divergence error (e.g., showing the distribution of data, being selective for ‘random structure’) would have been appreciated.
A maximal random effects structure was chosen, which is considered a good practice to include as many sources of variability in the data as possible. All prior choices were reasonable and well justified.

","This analysis can be regarded as a confirmatory analysis than an exploratory analysis. As a confirmatory analysis or a small contribution in a context of a collaborative exploratory project, examining only one acoustic variable might be a reasonable thing to do. 

However, considering that the research question broadly asked the typicality effect on acoustic outputs of speech production, probably more than one dependent variable should have been taken into consideration in the first place. Further, team cromileptes_saxat did not consider structural confounds – if they did, the conclusions would have been made stronger. While all adjectives were used for both typicality conditions (i.e. balanced), the different nouns with different inherent durations were not balanced. For the ‘typical’ NPs, the average syllable count for nouns in typical NPs is 2.8; for ‘atypical’ NPs, 2.2. The difference in the NP length could affect its duration (by polysyllabic shortening, for instance). 
","We evaluate the structure of the statistical model to be highly suitable. See more detailed comments above.

","Only typical / atypical combinations for the NF condition were examined (medium excluded). Tokens from utterances with any text on the notes tier (typically ""error"") were excluded, as were tokens where there was any pause between the adjective and noun as determined by the forced aligner. The choice of subsetting data to exclude the intermediate condition makes sense both a priori (as emphasising interpretability of the findings) and a posteriori (given the null result).


One strategy to mitigate the confounding effect of the word length could be examining a subset of the experimental items, e.g., disyllabic forms only; brau.nen Wal.nuss and grü.nen Boh.nen vs. grü.nen Möh.re, gel.ben Kir.sche and ro.ten Gur.ke.

","No transformation was applied before entering the duration values into the model – however, the model was lognormal, and also the priors were defined over log duration and not duration itself. This is appropriate since duration measurements are bounded at 0 and therefore follow a skewed distribution.

","All of us really enjoyed reading this report. Please take our somewhat picky comments as a sign of our positive engagement.

varanus_eulophotes,90,60,80,publishable with minor revision.,"The phonetic analysis seems sound, and the statistical analysis conforms to standards in the field, which is both a good and a bad point (see details below).","The authors report that the residuals of the LMM was not normally distributed. Then, they report that log- or inverse-transforming the dependant variables also lead to non-normally distributed residuals. From there, they chose to use a Gaussian model without transformation, ignoring the failure of their assumption checks. A better option would have been to try other transformations and/or other likely functions for the model.",The choice of variables seems sensible.,The choice of variables seems sensible.,"The structure of the model seems OK (although it could be improved, see the assumptions check issue explained above).","No data were excluded, which seems OK.",I think the data do not necessarily to be transformed but different distribution assumptions should have been tried within the statistical models (see my previous point).,I have no additional comments at this point. Congrats to the authors for a (overall) very sound and well conducted analysis.,2
varanus_eulophotes,70,90,80,publishable with minor revision.,"Analyzing mean f0 as an indicator of effect of typicality was an appropriate approach. The use of Praat scripts to analyze the pitch contour of each observation followed by use of the Get mean function is a good method for determining mean f0.One issue is that the use of the Montreal Forced Aligner may have led to several observations containing acoustic information beyond the desired word boundaries. The team found 4 instances of errors when manually aligning 50 random utterances to check the accuracy of the aligner. The analysis does not make it clear whether utterances from each speaker were manually checked for alignment. It is possible that if 4 out of 50 utterances (around 8%) included extra acoustic information, several of the total 895 observations may have also included extra acoustic information. This extra acoustic information  may not be problematic since the outcome being measured was pitch and not duration, but it is unclear what effect this analysis may have had on the outcome.
As for their overall statistical analysis, there weren’t any major problems. They also provided diagnostics of their data before interpreting the model, which is a good important step. However, it would be better if they also include a random slope in addition to the random intercept for speaker that they did include in their linear mixed model. 
",Their choice of linear mixed effects models for statistical analysis was appropriate considering they only looked at 1 continuous dependent variable.,They provided a good explanation with theoretical background as to why they chose to measure f0 as a cue to stress in German. They also explained well why they chose typicality as the only predictor variable.,"Based on the information from Kohler (2012) that pitch is the main cue for listeners to perceive stress in German, using mean f0 as the only outcome variable is a good choice. The research question is focused on typicality’s effect on speaker productions, so this team’s use of typicality as the sole predictor variable is also well reasoned.","Using linear regression mixed effects models for a single continuous outcome variable and single predictor variable is an appropriate statistical analysis. The fixed effect of typicality is appropriate. However, this team included random intercepts for speaker, but did not include random slopes, which are the norm in these models. If their team decides not to include random slopes on purpose, it is important to justify why that is.",This team mentioned excluding trials that did not have typicality ratings. This seems like an appropriate step since they were only focusing on typicality.,"The team provided a good explanation of log and inverse transforming the raw f0 values and how they still resulted in significant Shapiro-Wilks results. Since the transformed values were still not normally distributed, their choice of using the raw f0 values for their model was appropriate. However, it might also be useful to run a linear model with the centered variables, instead of the raw variables, to see if the output would be different.",NA,2
varanus_eulophotes,65,73,75,publishable with major revision.,"My rating was based on the replicability, accountability, and validity of the data extraction and statistical analysis. In general, the analysis is appropriate, but there are several potential drawbacks that may lead to erroneous interpretation of the data.",Linear regression is an appropriate start for the given outcome variable (mean f0).,"Variable selection, which was parsimonious and justified by previous research and theory, is appropriate and does not reflect data dredging. However, the selection of variables does not reflect the full experimental design. The overall choice of structure for the statistical model is appropriate, but formulaic; the structure could be better tailored to the hypotheses and the data.","The selection of variables is quite minimal and does not encompass the full experimental design. For example, foods and non-foods may show distinct effects of mean f0 for different typicalities, because non-foods are more likely to come in a variety of colors than food items. The model structure does not account for specific items, so there are several lurking variables that may underlie the null result.","The statistical model structure could be better suited to the data and specific hypotheses. For example, typicality is an ordinal variable, but this relationship is not captured by treatment coding. Additionally, the inclusion of only random intercepts by speaker fails to account for speaker-specific variation in the effect of typicality on f0 (i.e., the current model accounts for distinct mean f0 by different speakers, but some speakers may disproportionately distinguish typicality by f0). To capture this, a random slope for typicality should also be included. Finally, some notion of variance by item needs to be included in the statistical model. The typicality of each stimulus is different (even within typicality groupings), and typicality may interact with color and whether the item is a food or non-food. The authors' statistical model structure does not account for any of these potential covariates. 

Regarding the fitting procedure, it is apparent from the residuals that the outcome variable is not linear. Though the authors could have re-run the analysis on a subset of the data which is ""well behaved"" (cf. Baayen and Millin 2010), an analysis that accepts nonlinear outcome variables (e.g., GAMs) might be more appropriate.","The data selection process is accountable and minimizes issues with typographical errors, but it does not exclude those utterances which were tagged as errors in the annotation tier.","The authors attempted standard transformations (log, inverse) to normalize the residuals of the model to no avail. Rather than attempt another technique to model the data, the authors retained a poorly fitting model. The authors could have considered more sophisticated modeling techniques (e.g., Bayesian regression) or models that do not assume linear relationships between outcome and input variables (e.g., GAMs).",NA,1
varanus_eulophotes,50,70,60,publishable with major revision.,"The phonetic analysis is described in great detail. The authors aim to extract average F0 values for each trial’s adjective. However, we fear that they did not regard the following issue: As an example, let us assume that two adjectives are of similar segments, i.e. that we have two productions of ‘grüne’. The segments of these two instances, however, differ in their acoustic durations. While for the first ‘grüne’ we find a relatively long vowel of the first syllable (i.e. the stressed one), for the second ‘grüne’ we find a relatively short vowel of the first syllable but a rather long nasal. Now, measuring the average F0 for both instances of ‘grüne’, we potentially find very different values even if the F0 of the stressed vowel is identical. Following the references given by the authors, this presents an issue: The vowel of the stressed syllable is the ‘main bearer’ of stress in German and thus should be main subject to any changes due to typicality; averaging F0 across all segments (ignoring their durations) potentially occludes such an effect. In sum, we think that the idea of using an average F0 is straightforward and well-motivated; however, the implementation lacks an integration of necessary detail.
The statistical analysis consists of two parts: 1) descriptive results, 2) inferential results.
Concerning 1), we are not sure why the authors include purely descriptive observations of their data. The differences shown across levels of typicality and across adjectives are small (i.e. they are small in their actual dimensions as given in the pertinent plots). The reader is not able to intuitively take away anything from the presentation but uncertainty.
Concerning 2), the authors used linear mixed-effects regression to analyse the influence of typicality on their dependent variable of choice, i.e. average F0. The authors try to obtain a more normal distribution of their F0 variable without success. However, this demonstrates that they are aware of such issues. They continue fitting their model with typicality as categorical fixed effect (3 levels) and random intercepts for speaker. We would have wished for a more in-depth discussion of how the random effect structure was chosen and why no random effects for item and/or adjective combinations were included. The authors report on the model’s residual distribution; yet they do not discuss it. We miss trimming of said residuals to achieve more reliable regression coefficients.
The overall rating is the mean of both other ratings. We chose ‘publishable with major revisions’ as we find that our concerns regarding the measurement of average F0 values as well as an overhaul of the statistical analysis is required.",We find that linear mixed-effects regression is an adequate choice of statistical analysis type.,"The authors make use of one dependent variables: average F0. The authors do provide motivation for their choice of dependent variables.
As independent variables, typicality and speaker are used. Typicality being the predictor variable of interest, including it is straightforward and requires no further motivation. Speaker was included as random effect to account for inter-speaker differences. 
As briefly mentioned above, adjective and item were not included in the modelling process, i.e. as potential random effects. This is something we would have liked to see.","Typicality is the predictor of interest; thus it should be part of any model trying to answer the present research question. However, we would have liked to see some sort of random effect variable for adjective and/or noun combinations, as well as the use of the continuous typicality variable.","We find the structure of the presented models to be overall suitable for answering the present research question. As mentioned before, a more sophisticated (initial) random effect structure – even if it is found that is does not improve the model and is to be removed – is preferable.","Data for which no typicality rating was available was removed. While this in itself is well-motivated in an analysis of typicality, we are unsure why the authors lost about 57 % of their data.","The authors attempted to transform their dependent variable, average F0, to achieve of distribution closer to a normal distribution. However, they did not succeed. Their attempt is well-motivated; proceeding after failure (which by no means is a lack of skill but due the nature of the data) is justified.",We do not have any additional comments.,1

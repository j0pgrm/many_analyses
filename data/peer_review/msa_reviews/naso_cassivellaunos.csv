naso_cassivellaunos,60,90,80,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis seems appropriate and well-motivated. The results are consistent with the descriptive statistics. I have no objections with the selection or execution of the analysis. My major concern has to do with the data the analysis was performed on. In particular, the authors excluded a massive amount of data points, beyond the ones labeled as ""errors"" by the MSA project. In total, this analysis examined 336 tokens (approximately 11 per participant) out of the possible total 900 tokens. This was due to the type of adjective+noun combination chosen for the analysis, namely tetrasyllabic noun phrases, which reduced the possible A+N combinations to 6 (out of 15). The motivation to choose only A+N with this particular syllabic structure is unclear to me.",The analysis is clear and well-motivated. I would not change any aspects of it.,"The three outcome variables are hardly motivated. The analysis would have been stronger and more convincing if authors had explained why they chose these particular acoustic cues (and not others). In principle, I think they are good choices, but it would have been good to see the explanation and rationale as provided by they authors. 
The independent variable is the obvious one (typicality).","As explained in the previous point, it is not clear why the authors believed the three acoustic parameters would be good candidates to answer the research question. 
As for the independent variable (typicality), it is the expected variable to choose, so I have no issues here. However, the massive amount of data this analysis discarded meant that this variable was only viable with two levels (atypical vs typical), while the intermediate level the original data set contained (medium typicality) had to be excluded. The analysis could have been more informative if this third level had been included.",It seems well-structured.,"By working with two-syllable adjectives and nouns only, this analysis excluded too many tokens, as explained above. So much so that, for example, the 'medium typicality' condition ended up with one noun phrase only, and was thus eliminated from the analysis altogether. The authors did not explain why they chose to work with four-syllable combinations of N+A only, so I am not sure this type of exclusion was warranted.","The data transformation seemed appropriate. However, the measures for the three acoustic parameters seemed particularly difficult to understand. In particular, it took me many readings and some background searchers to understand the concept of ""mass"" as computed by ProPer, and I am still not sure I understand it completely. This could be my own limitation, but I can usually follow an analysis or explanations for data transformation if enough information is provided. I would have liked to see more detailed, easier-to-understand steps regarding how the three acoustic parameters were calculated.",NA,2
naso_cassivellaunos,95,95,95,publishable as is.,"Seemed good. I am unfamiliar with Bayesian statistics, so I cannot evaluate it very well, but there was a lot of detail in the methods and how the stats were run.","Bayesian was probably fine, though I'm not familiar with the phonetic analysis they did so I'm not sure what Bayesian offers that a frequentist analysis can't do.",Appeared to be fine.,Appeared to be fine.,Appeared to be fine.,"Appeared to be fine. I think cutting out words that didn't fit the tetrasyllabic frame they were aiming for might have lost some important data, but I appreciate the method for the sake of keeping things controlled.",I don't think there were any transformations.,I'm unfamiliar with what the phonetic analysis was about. They used a tool that I had never heard of and I don't think the explanation of what they were actually measuring was particularly clear. A better write-up might have explained things with a little more detail.,3
naso_cassivellaunos,81,90,85,publishable with minor revision.,"Neither of us is very familiar with Bayesian methodologies, from what we do know, the Bayesian analysis seems to have been carried out correctly.",A Bayesian approach seems suitable for the question type.,Variables used in the analysis are clearly defined and are justified.,See above,What the authors have done make sense. They explain their choices well.,"The reasoning behind only using a subset of the data is explained well and makes sense from an experimental point of view. However, with this particular data set, this means working with far fewer data points. The result of this is also the eventual loss of the medium category.

A potential issue which is not addressed is the production errors in the audio. There are 60+ such production errors that were not marked as such in the original files, this has very possible repercussions for the segmentation and mass analysis if these errors were indeed included.",The normalisation makes sense and is appropriate here.,NA,2

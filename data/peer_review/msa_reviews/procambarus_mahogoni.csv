procambarus_mahogoni,20,30,25,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"Both analysis script and written summary are not sufficiently comprehensive. A short report is totally okay, but content descriptions and explanations regarding dataset, extraction of studied parameter and statistical method are missing. The choice of mixed models is appropriate as are the dependent variables and fixed factor; however, repeating the fixed factor (typ_median) in the random factor structure is a highly irregular practice and, in this case, leads to estimation errors for the random effects. Two of the three statistical models resulted in singularities which makes the results unreliable and unpublishable. The selection of the analysed data subset is described inaccurately. The measurement methods and further standardization procedures are not discussed or derivable from the given information. Only the vowels in the colours were analysed but not the target words. There are no expectations as to the direction in which typicality could influence the three parameters studied.",Suitable. Mixed models allow for the integration of fixed and random factors. This makes it possible to comprehensively cover influences on the variation of the dependent variable. They are insensitive to an unbalanced number of values in the data set and therefore fit the given speech data.,"Not evaluable, as the process is not described and the selection of variables is not explained.","Overall, the used variables seem reasonable. However, more variables (especially, but not only,  more random factors and slopes) could have been integrated to improve the model. E.g.: word/vowel, possibly other speaker characteristics that could influence the F0 height or intensity (e.g. F0 is generally higher for women). It is unknown which variables were intentionally excluded from the model and it is not described why typ_median was used instead of the ternary typicality groups.","Dependent and independent variables are appropriate according to the research question. In each of the three statistical models, the fixed factor referring to the typicality score is at the same time integrated as a random factor within the same model, which is questionable.","Focus on NF is appropriate. The colours are compared, but not the target words. The advantage of using the colours is that there is a balanced set of words in relation to the typicality groups. It is unclear, however, why a typicality effect should show in the colour instead of the target words. The choice of which vowels to analyse is neither described nor evident from the script. From the attached data set, it can be assumed that the stressed vowel (V1) from the colour was analysed. The colour words in NF were: “gelb, grün, rot, orange, braun“. The stressed vowel in ""orange"" is the second and is in the csv coded as V1 and thus in the analysis. However, it looks like the first vowel /ɔ/ of “orange” was also analysed (the vowel /ɔ/ is also noted as V1 and is thus included in the analysis), although this is not the stressed vowel in the word.","These are difficult to understand. Were the speech signals opened in Praat and the analysed parameters determined manually and transferred to the table? Or were there any Praat-Scripts used for this? To which words do these vowel segments listed in the csv table belong, and which position do they occupy in the word (especially as regards the word “orange”, /ɔ/ und /a/ segments)? There is no explanation as to why the dependent variables were converted into a general standardised measure and not normalised in a speaker-specific way. A normalisation of vowel duration with regard to speaking rate instead of using the pure duration prior to standardisation would have been useful. Considering the intensity of the vowel not absolutely, but relatively - i.e. in comparison to other segments/vowels of the same speaker - could be worthwhile.
How exactly was F0 measured? Which algorithm was used to extract the F0 signal?",Calculation of the effect size (“Cohen D”) is neither described in detail nor is the method of computation shown.,0
procambarus_mahogoni,69,37,51,publishable with major revision.,"'-We didn’t manage to find annotationTextGrids;
- We don’t think that it is reasonable to analyze acoustic correlates (the team chose vowel duration, pitch and intensity of the stressed vowel in adjectives) without taking into account inter-speaker differences, a speaker’s gender, vowel quality and syllable structure.
- We don’t think that it is reasonable to use a variable of interest as a predictor, rather than as a predicted variable (the team decided to predict normalized duration/intensity/f0 by typicality not the other way around).
- In the mixed-effects model typicality is both a predictor and a random intercept. Possibly this is why two out of three models had singular fit.","Linear mixed effects models are suitable for this type of data, but we have identified flaws in the application of the models and their structure.","In general the choice of variables is reasonable, but
-The authors use normalized acoustic features, but they normalize them across all observations without grouping by speaker (we’ve found this in the code, not the pdf)
-The authors didn’t take into account the gender of the speakers.
-The authors predict acoustic features using typicality and not the other way around, hence it should be a multinomial regression, not a linear one.

Also the authors did not take into account the fact that each combination Color+Noun was produced twice and the production could be different from each other.
","The choice of variables is reasonable and is backed by literature, but the way they were used is flawed (see the comments above).","Since two of the three models had singular fit, it means that their structure was too complex for the provided inputs. Also the authors used typicality as both a predictor and a random intercept.

Also, please see comments in ""Please evaluate the process of choosing variables for and structuring the statistical model.""",The authors do not mention whether any data was excluded. Based on the variables used we could assume that for each token all of the three variables were available so there was no need to exclude any of them.,"We think that FPCA transformation of the data and making its result the main predicted variable in the statistical analysis is not justified by the researchers.
The authors use normalized acoustic features, but they normalize them across all observations without grouping by speaker.

procambarus_mahogoni,0,10,5,deeply flawed and unpublishable.,"The authors stated that they measured the duration, pitch and intensity in Praat, but they did not specify the details of this analysis, for example, how they annotated and spliced the audio files. They merely presented the measurements in an Excel file. There is very little presented and given.","The authors chose to carry out a mixed-effects linear regression. Given the dependent and independent variables and the research question of the study, the choice of the statistical analysis is well-motivated.","The authors analyzed the data by using linear mixed effects regression models. They did not compare the outcome of their model with the outcome of the null model, which is why we cannot be certain whether their model was different than the null model.","The authors selected duration, pitch, and intensity as dependent, and median typicality as the independent variable. As regards the dependent variables, the authors selected them based on the research conducted by Gordon and Roettger (2017). The dependent variables were well-motivated. The authors did not explain why they chose this one as their independent variable. They used the median that the organizers had included in the info they gave us. They also included random effects by-participant and by-mean typicality. Again, it is not clear why the authors selected the independent variable mean typicality as a random effect.","The authors analyzed the data by using linear mixed effects regression models.

Overall the report is quite short: some more detail on measurement extraction would be welcome for increased replicability (e.g. were the measures averaged over the vowel, or taken at the midpoint?), as well as more detail on whether the measures were transformed/scaled or if any exclusions were made (e.g. based on outlier status).",2

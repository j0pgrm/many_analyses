gymnothorax_spinulosus,81,75,78,publishable with minor revision.,"The analysis focuses on a specific, quantifiable aspect, i.e. intensity on the vowel of the accented syllable, as a general correlate of accentuation on the adjective component in the Adjective-Noun combinations with Adjective Focus (AF, pragmatically driven to distinguish two referents with different color). The group’s main hypothesis that in AF trials intensity should be larger for atypical than typical trials is clear and straightforwardly testable with a simple statistical model. The group’s second hypothesis, however, that the difference in accentuation on the adjective between the typical and atypical conditions would be maximal when the focus is instead on the Noun, is more problematic. It should have been reformulated as a follow-up hypothesis on whether typicality alone is sufficient to drive significant intensity differences in the absence of focus on adjectives.","The choice of a linear mixed model is appropriate as the authors considered speaker and target color as random factors, while the three accentuation modalities (LF, ANF and NF), and typicality were considered fixed factors.","The authors included typicality not as a categorical but as a continuous variable, which is an appropriate choice to account for the fact that there are different N of trials per condition.",The variables included have been appropriately chosen,"While backward deletion can be problematic, the statistical structure is appropriate.",The use of a Linear Mixed Model allows for the suitable inclusion of all conditions.,"Individual intensity data were normalized by subtracting the mean intensity in decibels over the entire stimulus sentence. This choice does not consider (nor did the authors test) the possibility of a trend in intensity across the entire sentence, positive or negative. If such a trend exists, the mean intensity would not represent a stable baseline.",There was no report or comment on the effect size of the results.,2
gymnothorax_spinulosus,80,75,74,publishable with major revision.,"The statistical analysis seems sound. The SPI is defined as the cumulative sum of signal energy (En) multiplied by the logarithmic expression of the maximum F0 divided by the minimum F0. However, we wonder why the index was calculated over the whole word, rather than at the elongated/stressed phoneme (or syllable containing the vowel), as in the cited reference paper for SPI. Perhaps the choice of the duration of the entire word introduces noise, reducing the difference between typical and atypical. We were not familiar with the SPI – has it been shown to be relevant outside of Parkinsonian contexts?

We also have some statistical concerns, which we share below in Q15.
","The choice of a linear mixed model is appropriate as the authors considered speaker and target color as random factors.  Target color accounts for word-level effects, which may be a confounding factor (i.e., some words may be longer than others, and therefore have more data going into their SPI estimate).","The authors included typicality not as a categorical but as a continuous variable, which is an appropriate choice. They only analyzed the NF condition, which contains a balanced number of typicality trials. The dependent variable (SPI) was chosen based on previous clinical work and calculated for all color words.","See before
",See before,"Given that typicality was only balanced for the NF condition, it seems appropriate to exclude the other conditions. The authors also excluded all data that contained comments in the text grid, such as “hesitation” or “noise.” A crucial information that is missing pertains to the number of trials this approach excluded. While LMMs handle missing data well, there was not so much data to begin with (30 participants with 10 trials per the three typicality conditions).","SPI was log-transformed as it was found to be non-normally distributed. Our understanding of LMMs is that the DV can be non-normal, as long as the residuals are normal. Perhaps this transformation is unnecessary and skewing results. It may be better to run the model with the non-transformed data and check the redisiduals for normality, before transforming (if necessary). Or perhaps switching to a GLMM is more appropriate to deal with non-normality.",NA,1
gymnothorax_spinulosus,100,90,90,publishable with minor revision.,"Overall, their handling and analysis of the data were exemplary (both preprocessing of the audio files and the statistical analysis). Their pipeline was straightforward and I believe they made informed decisions. 

",I have no issues with their choice of analysis.,"Pitch and intensity were chosen according to the hypothesis and prior literature, but only intensity was ultimately included due to project stipulations. Typicality was included as a continuous variable, and speaker and target color were included as random factors—accounting for all possible sources of variance. 

The authors used a backward selection process to determine the best model, which is a reasonable thing to do.","The variables seem appropriate for the hypothesis, and all relevant sources of variance seem to be accounted for in the model.",The structure of the model was suitable. They used the best fitting model found through backward selection.,"
The authors excluded measurements +/- 1.5 standard deviations from the median as outliers (108 measurements, or 5% of the data). I think this is a fair criterion, and the total number of excluded measurements seems reasonable.
","
Mean intensity over the critical vowel was normalized by subtracting it from the mean intensity over the entire stimulus sentence. This follows previous literature on phrasal prominence in German.

These transformations of the data seem appropriate. I think it was a good decision to segment the audio files and isolate the measurements to the vowel of the accented syllable of the critical adjective.
",Would have been better if they did did everything in one program instead of multiple programs.,2
gymnothorax_spinulosus,90,100,95,publishable as is.,"The analysis in general was sound.  The only consideration I would add is that only the intensity of the adjective was looked at, even though it's possible that intensity of the noun may have varied based on typicality, especially in the NF condition",The statistical analysis is sound.,"Again, the only consideration I would add is that only the intensity of the adjective was looked at, even though it's possible that intensity of the noun may have varied based on typicality, especially in the NF condition","The variables included were reasonable—condition, typicality, target color, and speaker.",The model was entirely suitable.  A backward stepwise process was used to confirm that the maximal model was appropriate.,Measurements ±1.5 sd from the median were excluded—about 5% of the data.  This is a reasonable cutoff.,Mean intensity of the critical vowel was normalized by subtracting it from the mean intensity over the whole sentence.  This is a reasonable transformation in order to filter out any effects of louder or softer sentences.,NA,3
gymnothorax_spinulosus,75,75,75,publishable with minor revision.,"Phonetic analysis: 
This analysis looked at (relative) vowel intensity. Intensity is a relatively inconsistent cue, compared to fundamental frequency or duration, to prosodic focus and stress. It is not clear from the methods document how precisely the recordings were made, but based on impressionistic auditory inspection of the recordings it appears that the participants did not necessarily have a constant distance between the mouth and the microphone. This makes any estimation of intensity inherently unreliable.
The reliance on uncorrected forced-aligned measurements is perhaps not the best possible approach, but there’s only so much time in life and we all have to make sacrifices.
Otherwise, the phonetic analysis appears to have been competently done.
Statistical analysis: 
The model overall appears to be well-constructed and well-though-out. As the analysis was done on the continuous typicality values (rather than the categorical one), we expected a graph with a continuous x-axis, rather than the categorical figure 1. The distribution of typicality values, however, may give some cause for concern as it is multimodal. It wasn’t mentioned in the results but it appears that there’s a main effect of focus condition, such that AF adjectives are louder than the other conditions – this is not unexpected but it bolsters the idea that the analysis is overall reliable.","A linear mixed effect regression model was used to analyze the data, which is appropriate.","The choice of IVs was reasonable. The choice of DV was questionable – as discussed above, there are better measurements (such as f0 or duration) that could have been made.",See above.,See above.,"The analysis included data from all focus conditions – i.e. NF, ANF, and AF. However, the typicality values are not evenly distributed throughout these conditions. Notably, only the NF condition features the full range of typicality (“atypical” through “typical”), the ANF condition only has phrases of high and medium typicality, while the AF condition only has phrases of low and medium typicality. This confound between focus condition and typicality makes interpretation of the results challenging.",No transformations were made. It may have been helpful to center the relative intensity data around zero before entering it into the model but it is unlikely that this would have affected the conclusions in a meaningful way.,No further comments.,2

trigonias_lachneri,80,35,50,publishable with major revision.,"The phonetic analysis methodology is justified with literature, and I appreciate that the composite measure makes it possible to avoid the problem of choosing which of F0, duration or intensity should be the dependent variable after starting the statistical analysis. But the measure that was used came from a paper that had nothing to do with phrasal prominence or typicality and might not have been sensitive enough for the purpose of this analysis. 
The biggest problem I see with the statistical analysis is the choice to simply ignore the AF and ANF conditions, and keep only data from NF condition. This choice is hard to understand for two reasons: (1) Phrasal prominence is bound to have a big impact on the stress pattern of the sentence, and it is possible or even likely that typicality, if it has an effect on prosodic prominence, would not have the exact same effect in different phrasal prominence conditions. And (2) this choice ignores the explicit design of the experiment. 
","The choice of mixed models is a good one for this type of dataset, in order to control for variability coming from the participants and the stimuli.","As explained above, it is hard for me to understand the choice of ignoring 2 experimental conditions in the statistical model and therefore not using condition as a variable in the model. It might also have made sense to include some effects usually included in phonetic analysis, for example a fixed effect of gender. It is possible however that the type of composite variable used makes adding a gender effect unnecessary. Also there is nothing about comparing the model with simpler models (or more complex models) to see if the model is the right one.
Besides, the choice of using the mean typicality (rather than the median, or the categorical values) is not explained. But I feel that justifying this choice (at least between mean and median) is a hard problem that we did not solve in our group either.","Typ_mean sounds good to us. The composite variable as well.
Random effects are ok. Condition variable is missing as we already explained.","Given the data that they have selected the model is suitable. But if they had kept data from all 3 conditions (AF,NF,ANF) they should have included the condition as a fixed factor in the model as well as the interaction condition:typ_mean
They could include all the random effects in the model , which is fine (but would probably not have been possible with a more complex model including condition). Also, they should have checked the normality of their residuals to verify that the model is suitable.","They excluded all data from NF and ANF condition.  They say they did so because in these conditions the typicality was not balanced. But to us this reason would only make sense if they used the typicality categories. Since they used the mean_typicality this should not be a problem. 
The data with errors was rightly excluded. I believe that it would have been necessary to further check the automatically extracted acoustic analyses to make sure they did not contain nonsensical values. For instance they could have excluded outliers in intensity /duration.

","Not knowing the measurement used very well, it is hard to judge if it is a priori reasonable to log-transform it. That being said if I understand correctly the model assumptions for mixed-effects models, it is the residuals of the model that should be normally distributed, not the data itself, so the justification provided for log-transforming data is not correct.",no further comment,1
trigonias_lachneri,95,100,99,publishable as is.,The preprocessing was well documented and walked the reader through each step. The choices were sufficiently explained and well reasoned with citations. The only additional step I would recommend is examining if the full model structure was needed.,"The model was appropriate. 
","SPI was chosen as a single variable to incorporate several key markers into one outcome variable using prior literature. Typicality was included as a continuous variable on the NF conditions, while speaker and color were used as random factors.","These choices are appropriate. 
","
Model structure was appropriate to capture random variance due to participants and stimuli as well as using continuous typicality ratings. Unclear if the random slopes were necessary but they did not seem to hurt the model. 
",Data was excluded by examining trials with comments due to error in the trial or noise. These choices seem reasonable.,"The SPI was log-transformed to deal with non-normality, which seemed like an appropriate choice.",The SPI  was developed by researchers to study prosody in patients with Parkinson's disease. It looks like the measure hasn't been picked up in the general literature.,3
trigonias_lachneri,90,90,90,publishable with minor revision.,"The only thing the analysis did not contain was a discussion of model selectionâ€”a fully specified model is used, but it's not clear that random slopes for color and speaker are justified.  This may have been analyzed, though, and just not reported.",Linear Mixed Model is an appropriate type of analysis for this data.,"I have to admit that I'm not very familiar with SPI, but the reasoning presented in the results document seems to justify its use.","Again, the variables used seem well-justified.","The only element that might be considered missing is a discussion of model selection, namely whether the speaker and color random slopes are justified in the model.  Why slopes and not intercepts?  If model selection was done, it would be great to include that in the text.","The only data that were excluded were items marked as errors or having other comments in the TextGrid files.  It's possible that there are a number of outliers that could have been excluded, so some discussion of these would be nice to include.",SPI was log-transformed because untransformed SPI was not normally distributed.  This is a reasonable choice.,NA,2

# Overview

This component hosts the data of the *Many Speech Analyses* project. For
an overview, see the [wiki](https://osf.io/rdtx5/wiki/home/).

There are 2 subdirectories:

-   The `norming/` directory holds the files of the norming study.
    -   `images/`: re-colored images for the norming study.
    -   `ratings/`: rating results of the norming study.
-   The `production/` directory contains two subdirectories:
    -   `audio/`: with `.wav` and `.TextGrid` files from the production
        experiment.
    -   `trial-lists/`: with `.csv` files with info on the trials from
        the production experiment.

See the `README.md` files in each directory for more information about
the contents.

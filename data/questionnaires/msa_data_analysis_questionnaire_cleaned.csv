Each member pushed and pulled from the Github (https://github.com/doomlab/many_speeches) which automatically synced with our OSF account (https://osf.io/ycn9r/). Further,  we set up bi-weekly meetings  (as needed) and discussed the selection of the dependent variable, the structure of the analyses, and how to prepare the information for sharing the final product.","The processing of the recordings and the extraction of acoustic measurements were done with Praat praat6209, R version 4.1.1, and rPraat v. 1.3.2.1 package.",Jason: Very familiar Erin: Super Duper Familiar Ryan: Slightly familiar,"We used intensity at the segmental level as our DV. Fundamental frequency, duration, and intensity are all commonly cited correlates of stress in languages such as English and German (Baumann et al., 2007; Braun, 2006; Braun & Ladd, 2003; Katz & Selkirk, 2011; Mixdorff et al., 2015; Sityaev & House, 2003; for a review, see Gordon & Roettger, 2017). We chose intensity both because it is a reliable indicator of 
stress and contrastive focus, and because of the difficulty extracting durational information from the raw recordings. We extracted peak intensity values from each sentence under the hypothesis that the target word would be subject to contrastive focus and likely show increased duration and intensity, as well as elevated F0.","The only IV we included was typicality (as a continuous measure). This was based on the question of interest (i.e., Do speakers phonetically modulate utterances to signal atypical word combinations?). We chose to use the continuous measure of typicality, over the categorical option, because we believed it provided more information in the continuous form to explore information about the nature of typicality across the spectrum. Further, this provided one parameter estimate (b) for typicality predicting our DV, rather than categorical comparisons between each level of typicality. We also included the random intercept of participants (filename below) to control for the repeated measurement of participants which was cross classified with the item target name. Intensity ~ typ_mean + (1|target_name) + (1|filename) + (1|filename:target_name)","IV: Typicality was treated as a continuous measure, as provided in the dataset (0 to 100 typical features of the object). 

DV: We extracted intensity in dB from the segment level. We broke down each segment into (approximately) milliseconds to find the maximum intensity for the segment.

We chose to include as many variables as possible to account for potential effects of these variables. Including especially names and colours of non-target objects, we took into account effects which might otherwise stayed hidden. Including ID as smooth term, we accounted for the natural order of the pitch values we extracted. TYPICALITY, finally, was the predictor of interest.","Dependent variable: F0 was extracted in Hz for each target word (i.e. the noun) at intervals of 10 ms. Before the statistical analysis, F0 was transformed to semitones with a baseline frequency of 50 Hz. For each target word, F0 was measured at 10 ms intervals, starting at the onset of the word. Thus, there are multiple data points per target word.

Independent variables: ID was included to account for the natural order of the pitch values we extracted.

We then wrote a custom Praat code to recombine the force-aligned TextGrid output with the original TextGrid (indicating Condition, Sentence Number; replacing the erroneous phone/word tiers with those from the MFA output). We also wrote a custom script to slow down the wavfile and TextGrid for one particularly fast talker (Subject “AL”); after running the slowed soundfile/TextGrid through MFA, we wrote another custom script to speed up the MFA TextGrid to match the original for the speaker. This speed manipulation was only needed for the one subject (AL).

Average acoustic measurements over each word were acquired through Praat, using a custom analysis script.
","Each acoustic feature was separately analyzed through linear mixed effects models, using the lme4 and lmerTest packages (Bates et al., 2015; Kuznetsova, Brockhoff, & Christensen, 2017) in R (version 4.1.2, R Core Team, 2021). Separate models compared the acoustic features of the noun and the color adjective of the NF trials.

The models on the nouns included a fixed effect of Typicality (Typical, Medium, Atypical; treatment coded, reference = Typical) and by-Speaker random intercepts and slopes for Typicality. The models on the adjectives additionally included by-Word random intercepts and slopes for Typicality. In case of non-convergence or singular fit, the random effects structure was simplified by iteratively removing the random effects associated with the least amount of variance (Barr et al., 2013). Each model was run twice (reference = Typical or reference = Medium) in order to produce estimates for all contrasts.
",Very familiar (primary method for analysis),"The dependent variables were mean and max f0, mean intensity and duration for each word (nouns and adjectives in NF), as all of these acoustic features have been found to correlate with focus (Breen et al., 2010; Lam & Watson, 2010; Roettger et al., 2019). 
","The only predictor we used was the Typicality category assigned to each color-noun pair, as this was the primary manipulation in the study. 

We originally intended to include the focus condition (NF vs AF) as an additional predictor, but decided not to due to limitations of the study design (see answer to question 11).
","Dependent variables: 
Average mean and max f0, intensity (in dB) and duration were extracted at the word-level, from the nouns and color adjectives in the NF trials. Similarly to previous studies (e.g., Lam & Watson, 2010) we used a single average acoustic measurement over each word, rather than over individual vowels, because different target words in this experiment (the focused nouns) contain unequal numbers of vowels. 

Only pitch measurements within the plausible range of 78 to 300 Hz were used to calculate mean and max f0 over each word.

Independent variable:
Typicality included three levels: Typical, Medium and Atypical. Each color-noun pair in the NF condition had been already categorized as part of one of the three levels by the study coordinators based on the norming study. Typicality was treatment coded, with the reference level = ‘Typical’.
","Pitch was converted to semitones (ST; relative to 75 Hz) with the hqmisc R package (Quené, 2014), so that f0 would be on a linear scale. 

In our dataset, non-transformed f0 measurements (in Hz) are found under the column names “Mean_f0” and “Max_f0”. Transformed f0 measurements (in ST) are found under the column names “Mean_f0_st” and “Max_f0_st”.
","Only sentences in the critical Noun Focus condition were analyzed. Sentences that had been marked as containing a speech or structure error, noise or hesitation were excluded from the analyses.

Acoustic measurements exceeding 3 standard deviations from each speaker’s mean were excluded from the analyses.
","The decision was based on beta coefficients from the mixed effects models (which also represent simple effect sizes) and the corresponding p-values, for each contrast among the three Typicality levels.

","We chose to report simple effect sizes rather than a standardized measure of effect size (e.g., eta squared), following Baguley (2009). Simple effect sizes (i.e. unstandardized regression coefficients) are easier to interpret in relation to each dependent measure of interest, and are automatically computed as the estimated beta coefficient of treatment-coded contrasts in mixed effects models. Thus, the effect sizes are in the units of each acoustic measure (Intensity: dB; Duration: ms; Mean/Max f0: ST).

This method allowed us to report an effect size for each contrast of interest (e.g., Atypical vs. Typical), while common methods to acquire standardized effect sizes (e.g., eta squared using the R package effectsize; Ben-Shachar et al., 2020) only lead to a single, less interpretable value for the effect of Typicality across all contrasts. The 95% confidence intervals for the simple effect sizes were calculated using the R package emmeans (Lenth et al., 2019).","We had to make two changes to our planned analyses, resulting from limitations of the production study design.

First, we initially intended to include by-Word random effects for the noun models to account for differences in baseline acoustic measurements (e.g., certain words being overall longer than others). However, we did not ultimately include this random effect for the noun models because, contrary to the color adjectives, target nouns were not fully crossed with Typicality (each noun was only associated with one Typicality level). 

Second, we originally intended to compare Noun Focus (NF) and Adjective Focus (AF) conditions to determine whether the effect of typicality on the noun and adjective varied as a function of whether the noun or the adjective were in focus. However, in the end we only analyzed NF trials because the data were not balanced. In the AF trials, the nouns were not counterbalanced across the 3 Typicality categories (typical, medium, atypical), but rather only contained atypical food color-noun combinations and some medium-typicality non-food nouns.

We suggest that in the final paper resulting from this study, the study description in the method should be revised to more clearly differentiate between the designs of the NF, AF and ANF conditions, as the current study description and examples used (e.g., “yellow banana” vs “blue banana” for the AF condition, which were not actual items used in AF) led us to misinterpret the design.

We chose these variables because they are two of the few vowel variables that do not differ between male and female speakers. Since we were not provided with the gender of the participants, we did not feel we could use f0 or vowel quality, as both of these variables (and their measurements) depend heavily on vocal tract size. 
","We included ‘typicality’, ‘color’, and ‘observation’ as independent variables (fixed effects) and ‘participant’ as a random effect. We included ‘typicality’ to respond to the research question of whether speakers acoustically modify their speech with different color + noun typicality combinations. We included color in order to examine the differences in acoustic realization between the five colors. We also included Observation, a numeric variable assigned during data collection, as a possible task effect of where in the experiment the token appeared. Given what we know about variation in duration based on vowel identity, we tested models that included an interaction between color and typicality, so we could evaluate each color’s typicality separately. Finally, we included participants as a random effect to account for interspeaker variation.","Because the stressed syllable of the adjective started with either a liquid (grün, roten, braun, orangen) or a stop (gelb), we determined that measuring consonantal features such as VOT would be inappropriate. Therefore, we chose to segment the stressed vowel of each adjective. The target nuclear vowel (that of the stressed syllable in each color word) was segmented by hand using the following criteria for onset and offset of the vowel, primarily relying on oral consonantal constriction events (as recommended by Turk et al. 2006:3).
Onset:
In the case of vowel nuclei preceded by a liquid, we relied on a change in waveform amplitude between the preceding voiced liquid and the vowel nucleus, as well as clear onset of energy in the vowel’s second formant. For vowels that followed stops, we again relied on an increase in waveform amplitude, periodicity in the waveform, and clear formant energy to mark the onset of the segment (the stop burst was not included in the vowel nuclei segment). In the few instances of mismatch among these three parameters, we particularly relied on the onset of the second formant (following Turk et al. 2006) to identify oral stop closure releases. 

Offset: 
To determine the offset of the vowel nuclei, we utilized both the waveform and spectrogram and placed the offset of the vowel at the point at which amplitude in the waveform decreased accompanied by cessation of formant energy (relying specifically on the second and third formants (following Turk et al. 2006:7) when there were instances of formants offsetting at different times). 

Following nasal (grun, braun, orangen): The nasals were often accompanied by abrupt spectral changes at closure onset (cf. Turk et al. 2006:12), particularly in the middle and higher-frequency regions due to nasal antiformants, and a decrease in waveform amplitude.
Following stop (roten): The offset of the vowel was marked at the oral stop closure, indicated by a cessation of formant energy and a decrease in overall amplitude.
Following liquid (gelb): Many times there was no clear decrease in waveform amplitude, signaling a deleted or coarticulated /l/ in the word ‘gelben’. In these instances, the offset of the vowel was marked at the oral stop closure [b].

Duration: The Praat script measured the duration of the segmented target vowel.
Intensity: The Praat script measured the maximum intensity of the target vowel. 
Typicality: Typical, medium, atypical
Color: Grün, Gelb, Ro:ten, Braun, Orangen 
","We centered and scaled the duration and intensity_maximum variables to ensure normality of our data distribution. 
","During our segmentation process, we noted that some of the trials were marked with “Error” codes on the textgrid and excluded these observations from our analysis. In addition, there were some trials that were marked with “hesitation break”. If the hesitation break affected the target color + noun combination, we excluded the observation, and if it did not affect the target, we included the observation. 
Additionally, since we had normalized the duration and the intensity measures, we excluded any values that were +/- 2 standard deviations from the mean (in the case of duration, this excluded N=30 observations, leaving 830 observations, and in the case of intensity, N=33 observations were excluded, leaving 827 observations for the analysis. 
","We used p-values (alpha value of 0.05) to determine whether there was a significant effect of the independent variables on duration or intensity. 
We compared the AIC values of the models to determine the model with the best fit. 
Additionally, we calculated the marginal and conditional R-squared values of each of the models (from Nakagawa and Schielzeth (2012), using the performance R package (Lüdecke et al. 2021)). The “winning” model in each case was the model with the lowest AIC and the largest marginal and conditional R-squared values.",We found no significant main effects.,n/a,"We determined early on that we would not be able to use f0 or vowel quality, two of the predictors we thought would be most influenced by typicality, without making assumptions about the gender of the participants. We decided that it was not a sound decision to make this assumption and thus were not able to include these predictors. 
We encountered a couple of issues with segmenting which were resolved with our inter-rater reliability checks: 
At times the vowel was nasalized. 
Because of the variation in liquid realization, segmenting words such as “braunen”, “orangen”, “rot”, and “gelb” proved challenging at times.

The reason for choosing vowels for the investigation of the effects of typically was based on previous research (Bell et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2009; Bybee & De Souza, 2019; Jurafsky et al., 2000; Seyfarth, 2014). that predictability has an influence on vowels' qualitative and quantitative characteristics.","Typicality. Speakers are often overinformative, i.e. they use referring expressions that are more specific than necessary. This redundancy has been argued to facilitate object identification and more efficient communication (Arts et al. 2011, Paraboni et al. 2007, Rubio-Fernandez 2016). For example, Degen et al. (2020) show that modifiers that are less typical for a given referent (e.g. a blue banana) are more likely to be used in an overinformative scenario (e.g. when there is just one banana). As a result, atypical objects would be used in a more overinformative scenario than typical objects.","Average vowel duration was computed by averaging individual vowel durations per word for that specific speaker in that condition. For instance, <tomate> in an atypical condition has three vowels 'o', 'a' and 'e' with the duration being 0.05, 0.06, 0.05, so the average duration would be 0.053.

Acoustic features were extracted using the openSMILE 3.0 toolkit and the “extended Geneva Minimalistic Acoustic Parameter Set” (eGEMAPS) v02, which comprises 25 acoustic features measured at 10 ms intervals. These features were extracted using the reticulate R package interface to the openSMILE Python package.","We trained an extreme gradient boosting model to perform a multiclass classification task, using the XGBoost R package.

Rationale: If speakers do systematically modulate utterances, then there will be phonetic and acoustic consequences of this modulation.

Most authors have used LMM’s before and one of the authors has completed a summer school on statistics which specifically addressed LMM’s using R.,"In the context of the research question “Do speakers phonetically modulate utterances to signal atypical word combinations” we decided to focus on phonetic prominence as a potentially modulated aspect of the speech signal. This was motivated by the assumption that typicality would be related to predictability in context, and predictability has proven effects on prosodic prominence (e.g. Turnbull 2017).   Phonetic prominence was measured using  Tykalova et al’s “Stress Pattern Index” (SPI), which is a composite measure of phonetic prominence, taking F0 variation, duration and relative intensity into account. We reasoned that a composite measure was well suited to combine some of the multi-variate effects of prosodic prominence into a single outcome variable.","As the research question focuses on the relationship between typicality and prosodic emphasis overall and only one effect size is of interest, we  used the mean typicality ratings as a continuous predictor and we report the overall relationship between the typicality rating and the prosodic prominence measure.","The DV phonetic prominence was operationalised using the SPI as described in [1] in our own implementation (see Praat script SPI_and_friends4anon.psc) The formula used was:
SPI = (1+ln(F0max/F0min))ΣEn. 
Minimal amplitude over the analysed unit was set to 0 dB.
SPI was originally devised as a word level measure and in accordance to that it was calculated over the total duration of the colour word in the NF condition.

Utterances were then force-aligned to isolate the stressed vowel in the adjective of interest. Forced alignment was completed using the align function of the Montreal Forced Aligner v 2.0.0rc3 (McAuliffe et al., 2017), using Prosodylab pretrained models and dictionaries for German. The Prosodylab German dictionary was adapted to specifically reflect the combinations of morphemes present in the adjectives of interest. The force-aligned utterances were subset to the stressed phones in the adjectives of interest using Python libraries Parselmouth-Praat, and PraatIO (Mahrt, 2016).

There are always more to learn about using Bayesian statistics, such as specifying priors. However, I feel comfortable to run Bayesian mixed effects models with acoustic variables.","We chose four dependent variables which all included acoustic measures of the stressed vowel of the target word: fundamental frequency, duration, first formant frequency, and second formant frequency. We chose fundamental frequency and duration as indicators of changes in prosodic production of the target word. If there is a difference by typicality, then speakers are likely to emphasize the target word using fundamental frequency and duration. We would typically add intensity as a measure as well but we decided not to include it in this analysis since we didn't have information about microphone distance. We also included the first and second formant frequency to determine whether speakers used hyperarticulation to signal typicality.","The only predictor we chose was categorical typicality. We thought about running a separate analysis with the quantitative typicality measure. However, the researchers categorized typicality in the datasheet so we decided to stick with the designated categories. We chose to analyze typicality because the purpose of this analysis was to determine if speakers would alter word production based on typicality. It therefore made sense to include typicality as the predictor of the acoustic production of the target word.","We operationalized our four dependent variables as the stressed vowel of the target word. There is evidence that when speakers alter the production of a word for emphasis, they mainly alter the stressed vowel of that word. Additionally, acoustic measures such as fundamental frequency are more reliably measured from vowels rather than consonants. The first and second formant frequencies were measured from the midpoint of the stressed vowel which reduces the chance of including changes in production due to coarticulation.","All dependent variables were log transformed in the statistical model by specifying a logarithmic distribution for the outcome variables. To do this, I specified the logarithmic distribution in the family function in brms.","Force-aligned phone intervals shorter than 50 ms did not meet our duration heuristic for plausibility and were excluded from further analysis. Candidate formant tracks not meeting heuristic standards (e.g., F1 > 1200 Hz | F2 < 600 Hz) were penalized during the selection step.",We used two criteria for decision making: Bayesian credible intervals and probability of direction. An effect was considered robust if the credible interval excluded zero and if the probability of direction was greater than 95%.,The effect size was a 95% credible interval and 95% probability of direction.,Standardized mean difference.,"There were a few data preprocessing steps we had to add in that we originally did not account for.

The rationale behind choosing these words was that these were the manipulated words, and it might be easier to see differences in how something is being said between conditions by narrowing down our analyses to these words. Adjectives and Nouns were both analyzed, as either could carry focus depending on condition. The cues that were selected are cues that are often argued to be acoustic correlates of focus. Duration was log transformed to make duration values more normally distributed. F0 values were extracted at the word onset, midpoint, and offset so that they may serve as a coarse grained approximation for F0 contours for each word.","The independent variables were the continuous typicality score, the experimental condition for each sentence, the part of speech status of the word that is being analyzed, and the interactions between these terms. 

The continuous typicality score was chosen for 2 reasons: firstly, it offers a more detailed measure of typicality than the binned categories, and secondly, not all conditions were equally represented in all binned categories, but they all did have some continuous typicality value. The experimental condition (focus location) was explored because we thought it might interact with the typicality of the phrase. Similarly, the part of speech status was included since the experimental condition should determine which word carries focus and therefore might affect the prosodic cue values for each word depending on condition.","All dependent variables were extracted from the word level of the critical adjective-noun pair. Duration values were log transformed to normalize their distribution. All F0 values were centered on a by-talker basis so that rises and falls might be treated similarly even if talkers had different baselines in pitch. F0 values were extracted from the onset, midpoint, and offset of each of the 2 words in the critical adjective-noun pair. 

For the independent variables, part of speech was a categorical variable that specified whether the analyzed word was the adjective or the noun from the critical adjective-noun word pair.

Acoustic-phonetic measurements for analysis of suprasegmentals were extracted from the aligned TextGrids and audio files using Praat (v 6.1.50). F0 measurements were extracted with a pitch floor of 50 Hz and ceiling of 600 Hz.

Dynamic F1/F2 vowel measurements were extracted using the FastTrack Praat plug-in (Barreda 2021) with the default settings.

Data analysis, visualisation and modelling were performed in R. Bayesian linear mixed-effects models were run using the brms package. Generalised Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs) were run and analysed using the mgcv, itsadug and tidymv packages.",We ran Bayesian linear mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution for each outcome variable. Priors on fixed effects were specified with Gaussian distributions; priors on random effects were specified with t-distributions (see report for more details). We ran GAMMs for modelling dynamic formant trajectories.,The team member who ran the models is very familiar with the technique. The team member who ran the GAMMs is somewhat familiar with the technique.,"DVs were: relative duration, relative intensity, max F0 and F0 range. Measurements were taken in the colour adjective only (see report); Relative duration and relative intensity were relativised to relevant properties of each target utterance. 

Relative duration = duration [in milliseconds] of the stressed rhyme of the adjective, as a proportion of the average syllable duration in the target utterance. Average syllable duration in each target utterance was calculated by dividing each utterance duration by the number of syllables in a canonical/citation production of the target utterance.

Relative intensity = mean intensity [in dB] in the stressed rhyme of the adjective as a proportion of mean intensity [in dB] in the whole target utterance. 

Max F0 = max F0 [in semitones relative to the speaker’s minimum F0] in the adjective. The speaker’s minimum F0 was the minimum F0 value for that speaker across all target adjectives. 

F0 range = max F0 in the adjective minus min F0 in the adjective [both in semitones relative to the speaker’s minimum F0]. The speaker’s minimum F0 was the minimum F0 value for that speaker across all target adjectives.

Rationale: We consider these to be the minimal set of DVs appropriate for estimating suprasegmental acoustic cues to prominence in German. The measures must be relativised to compensate for between speaker and/or item variation in speech rate, amplitude and F0 span/range. 
--
We also analysed F1/F2, using dynamic formant tracking through the stressed vowel in the noun and adjective in each utterance. These measures were taken at regular 2ms intervals throughout the duration of the vowel using the default settings in FastTrack (Barreda 2021). 

We discussed additional potentially relevant measures of F0, to compensate for audible variation in the data in choice of phonological pitch accent across speakers/items. However, manual coding (prosodic annotation) of the data was not possible to complete in the time available, and we would have had to rely on annotation by a single team member, with no scope for checks on annotation (e.g. inter-transcriber agreement).","IVs in the Bayesian models were: typicality (typical, medium, atypical); syllable structure of the stressed syllable in the adjective (CV, CVC, CCV); trial; plus the interaction between typicality and trial.

Rationale: Typicality is the manipulated variable of interest. Trial is included to control for task fatigue as the experiment progressed, which interacts with typicality since each participant produced items in a different pseudorandomized order. Syllable structure of the stressed syllable in the adjective is included because this varies unevenly across target items; syllable structure variation will affect duration of the stressed rhyme directly, and may have indirect effects on intensity and F0 alignment/scaling.","All DVs in the Bayesian models were relativized as set out above (and pasted again below). We did not include speaker sex in the model as we do not have any specific expectations of variation in the DVs by sex or gender. The effect of speaker sex on F0 was controlled by relativizing of F0 measures to a relevant measure for each speaker, as described. For the GAMMs, the effect of speaker sex on F1/F2 was controlled by including random by-speaker smooths in the model (subsuming intercepts and slopes)

Relative duration = duration [in milliseconds] of the stressed rhyme of the adjective, as a proportion of the average syllable duration in the target utterance. Average syllable duration in each target utterance was calculated by dividing each utterance duration by the number of syllables in a canonical production of the target utterance.

Relative intensity = mean intensity [in dB] in the stressed rhyme of the adjective as a proportion of mean intensity [in dB] in the whole target utterance. 

Max F0 = max F0 [in semitones relative to the speaker’s minimum F0] in the adjective. The speaker’s minimum F0 was the minimum F0 value for that speaker across all target adjectives. 

F0 range = max F0 in the adjective minus min F0 in the adjective [both in semitones relative to the speaker’s minimum F0]. The speaker’s minimum F0 was the minimum F0 value for that speaker across all target adjectives.","Relative duration: we first extracted values for the duration of the stressed adjective rhyme (d$adj_vdur) and the duration of the target utterance (d$utt_dur) in seconds. These were converted to milliseconds (using the same column names). Then we calculated the average syllable duration (d$avg_syll_dur) by dividing the full utterance duration by the target number of syllables (d$n_syll). Finally, we subtracted the average syllable duration from the duration of the stressed rhyme in the adjective to get the column d$rel_dur. This was then centred on the overall mean in the dataset (d$Nreldur).

Relative intensity: we first extracted the amplitude in pascal for the stressed rhyme of the adjective (d$adj_v_amp) and the entire utterance (d$utt_amp). We transformed each of these from pascal to decibel (dB) using a reference level of 0.00002 pascal. This resulted in the columns d$adj_v_intens and d$utt_intens. Finally, we subtracted the utterance intensity from the adjective rhyme intensity to get the column d$rel_intens. This was then centred on the overall mean in the dataset (d$Nrelintens).

Max F0 and F0 range: we extracted the max F0 (d$adj_maxf0) and min f0 (d$adj_minf0) from the adjective in hertz. We transformed each individual max f0 and min f0 from hertz to semitones using the speaker’s absolute minimum f0 as the reference level (d$adj_maxf0_st, d$adj_minf0_st). For F0 range, we then subtracted the transformed min F0 from the transformed max F0. The final variable for max F0 is in d$adj_maxf0_st and the final variable for F0 range is in d$f0range_st. These were then centred on the overall mean in the dataset (d$Nadj_maxf0_st, d$Nf0range_st).

The raw F1/F2 values (f1_raw, f2_raw) were centred and scaled using the scale function in R to normalise for between-speaker differences in absolute formant frequencies (f1_norm, f2_norm). Analysis was conducted on both sets of values.","We excluded all tokens with a non-empty ‘notes’ field in the relevant trial list, resulting in 54 exclusions. No further observations were excluded.","Based on the posterior distribution of Bayesian linear mixed effects models, the analysis tests whether the reported effect is reliably different from 0 by examining whether the reported 95% credible interval spans 0. If the reported 95% CI excludes 0, then we conclude that the estimated effect is reliable in its direction and in its deviation from 0. Specifically, for a positive mean estimate, we ask whether p(β≤0| model,data) < 0.025. For a negative mean estimate, we ask whetherp(β≥0| model,data) < 0.025. 

For the dynamic formant analysis, differences between the typicality conditions were diagnosed through a combination of:
- the significance of the parametric and smooth terms for typicality in the model summaries for F1 and F2
- visual inspection of the (overlapping/non-overlapping) confidence intervals in plotted GAMM smooths
- analysis of difference smooths between the typicality conditions within each vowel to reveal which parts of the trajectories significantly differ as a function of typicality
- model comparison with ML estimation between full models containing the typicality predictor and null models containing only the vowel category predictor
","For the suprasegmental variables analysed using Bayesian models, we report the effect of the medium and atypical conditions on each dependent variable as a deviation from the typical condition along with the 95% credible interval. These are the beta coefficients from a Bayesian linear mixed effects model, in which typicality was treatment coded and the typical condition was treated as the baseline.

The features were computed from frame-level features of each acoustic frame for the whole phrase. All independent variables are continuous acoustic features.

The dependent variable is a categorical variable with three levels, atypical, typical, medium. They were one-hot encoded, which is a standard practice for classification tasks.

","For the 88 acoustic features, there were multiple transformations applied to them. The main idea is to extract frequency, amplitude and spectral parameters from each frame and then compute summary statistics from them (mean, variance, etc.).
Details can be found in Section 3.1 and 3.2 of this paper: https://sail.usc.edu/publications/files/eyben-preprinttaffc-2015.pdf.

For the extracted acoustic features, we applied mean-variance normalization (z-score) using the StandardScaler() in Sklearn.

The results were obtained through cross validation, that is, training the model on all but one speaker and testing the model on the unseen speaker.

PC2 corresponded to 20.8% of the variation in the F0-normalized dataset, and the statistical analysis revealed that it effectively captured at least part of the relevant variation present in the data.","We used typicality as the only independent variable, given that this predictor directly corresponds to the proposed research question. Given that the focus condition would also likely elicit significant differences between f0 slopes, we only used the NF (noun focus) condition for the final analysis, which was also the only condition marked for typicality in the provided materials. As typicality only applies to the FOOD subset, the NON-FOOD subset of examples was not used in the analysis.","The variables time and f0 were extracted both by (prep.) phrase and by word. The prepositional phrase was created by combining the data extracted for sequences of four words: the word auf and the article, adjective and noun that followed it (e.g., auf den orangen Kartoffeln). The variable gender was only used for parameter setting in the extraction of f0 values in Praat.","We min-max transformed the time values, which are found under “time”, by subtracting the minimum value to each observation and then dividing it by the range with the function (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)). F0 was also z-transformed (x–mean(x)/sd(x)) to account for inter-speaker variation using the function scale(), and the resulting z-scores can be found in column ‘f0.z’. Normalized Hz values were then reconstructed from the z-scores by multiplying z-scores by the mean of the SDs of all speakers and then adding the grand mean of the sample to the resulting value, and these can be found in column ‘f0.norm’.","Examples with annotations in the notes tier (labeled as error, hesitation break, error2, break and doubt) were excluded.

Since adjectives were balanced across the three conditions, we decided to focus primarily on the adjective, but included the article and noun for good measure. 
Duration of article
Duration of adjective
F0 peak of article
F0 peak of adjective
F0 peak of noun
We hypothesized that due to the nature of the experiment, namely seeing objects with all kinds of colours, participants might vary in their f0 and durations of the adjective as a function of the adjective-noun’s typicality.

We hypothesized that this effect could go either of two directions:  1) the typical adjective-noun combinations, after speakers have seen so many unusual or impossible combinations, could lead speakers to add prosodic emphasis in the typical condition, probably leading to greater duration or f0 somewhere in the article-adjective-noun sequence; or 2) speakers could add prosodic emphasis to the atypical adjective-noun combinations because they are surprising.  Direction 1 (emphasis on typical) would reflect a reaction of surprise at finally seeing a picture that makes sense, while direction 2 would reflect emphasis on novel and unlikely combinations.","We selected typicality as the independent variable and coded this as a fixed effect in the model.  Typicality was selected since the research question asked whether the typicality of the adjective-noun combination would have acoustic effects.  We did not expect there to be any effect of gender or age (and, moreover, this information was not provided), and so did not include them as predictors.","Duration of the article and adjective were measured based on our segmentation criteria, which were hand-segmented according to the following principles:

The onset of the article was the beginning of the burst, or if none was visible, the onset of formant structure of the vowel.  The offset of the article (and hence onset of the adjective) was defined by the offset of F2 or the onset of silence/creak for “der”, and the offset of the nasal formant structure for “den”. In the case of ""der"" followed by an initial vowel with no creak or glottal stop, the offset of the article was placed at halfway through the F2 transition.

Since all adjectives end in [n], the offset of the adjective was taken to be the offset of nasal formant structure.  When the following noun began with a nasal [m] (as in Mandarine and Möhre), the boundary was taken to be the point when the distribution of frequencies of energy suddenly change in the spectrogram and waveform; in a handful of cases, there was no clear boundary and so the midpoint between the nasal formant structure of the [n#m] sequence was selected.

Peak f0 was extracted from the word for the article and adjective.  For the noun, peak f0 was extracted from the interval beginning at the onset of the noun, and ending at the offset of the stressed syllable.  For all three f0 measures, the peak was measured as of 30 ms after the onset of the word in question, in order to eliminate microprosodic effects associated with voiceless consonants.
",We did not transform any of the variables.,"
All tokens marked as having been produced with an error or hesitation were omitted, as were all tokens from one speaker (JW_3) who had a particularly high error rate; thus 70 tokens were removed, leaving a total of 830 observations over 29 participants before outliers were removed.

For each acoustic measure, data were inspected to ensure that measures were roughly normally distributed.  Outliers for the peak f0 measures were defined using the absolute deviation around the median by participant, using the “mad” function from the “stats” package (see Leys et al., 2013).   The rejection criterion for the peak f0 of the adjective and noun was set at 2.5 standard deviations from the absolute deviation around the median; the rejection criterion was set at 2 standard deviations for the peak f0 of the determiner, as this less conservative cutoff was necessary to eliminate cases of creak that persisted throughout the determiner.  Thus for the peak f0 measures, the total number of observations were:  816 observations for the adjective; 802 for the noun; and 671 for the article.  No outliers were removed for the duration measures of the noun and adjective.

","Creak that persists throughout the entire article, or rarely throughout the entire adjective or portion of noun measured.  We did not anticipate that two speakers would often creak throughout so much of their speech, making f0 measurements bimodal and unreliable for the question we were asking.

We didn't anticipate the pronunciation ""orangenen"" for ""orangen"", but this is unlikely to cause any problems in the analysis because of the overall variability of adjective durations and the matching of adjectives across conditions.

However, it was necessary for us to first modify the textgrids provided to us by the MSA team, as trigger utterances were not segmented in the original textgrids and we wished to analyse them.  We use Praat to find silences, and then a Python script populated the interval tiers with the appropriate text (by reference to the participant csvs).   We manually checked the alignment and corrected any which were not  appropriatelyaligned. Then we uploaded the newly segmented and corrected textgrids into LaBB-CAT, the browser-based Language, Brain & Behaviour Corpus Analysis Too (LaBB-CAT; Fromont & Hay, 2012)., so that the individual phones could be automatically force-aligned using the BAS webservice, WebMAUSBasic.

We also used LaBB-CAT to calculate speech rate based on the CELEX lexical database (Baayen et al., 1996) for German, and the LaBB-CAT interface with praat to extract our acoustic variables, using the nzilbb.labbcat and rPraat R libraries.  Within R, we joined the resultant dataframe to the original MSA data, namely the participant/trial information and the typicality judgements from `ratings_summary.csv` collected from the original MSA database (Coretta, Roettger, & Casillas, 2021).

In addition to these programmes for extracting acoustic measurements, we also utilised Python and R programming (Van Rossum & Drake, 1995; R Core Team 2022) to further organise the TextGrids and acoustic data.

After we had prepared the textgrids and extracted the acoustic measurements, we used R to organise the data. We created an R script that would process and evaluate the measurements; the script was divided into two discrete chunks, to complete two separate tasks, thereby creating two steps.

In the first step, the first chunk of the script extracted the acoustic information of the vowels in ‘der’ and ‘den’ from the [LaBB-CAT](https://labbcat.canterbury.ac.nz/system/) corpus which was specifically created for this analysis, while, the second chunk of the script joined that dataframe to the original MSA data, namely the participant/trial information and the typicality judgements from `ratings_summary.csv` collected from the original MSA database (https://osf.io/5agn9/?view_only=6fec040a9589499bb9998240bdab12a1). 

Next, we used the nzilbb.labbcat package in R to extract the trialnumber and syllable articulation information: trialnumber, syllableCount, syllablesPerMinute, participant_syllablesPerMinute. 

F1 and F2 formants of the midpoint of a segment and the pitch and intensity measures were processed with Praat through the nzilbb.labcat package. Following this a combined analytical dataset was generated with dplyr and tidyr that is used for the modelling analysis detailed below (see also ‘Data Dictionary’ for additional information on individual variables).","In order to analyse the acoustic measurements extracted from Praat our initial analyses included linear mixed-effects models (lmer) using the model including random intercepts and random slopes.  Our final analysis only used intercepts.

A linear mixed-effects model (lmer) is a statistical model where fixed and random effects are added to simple linear modes in order to explain the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. To apply these models we used the lme4 package which allowed us to fit a linear mixed-effects model to our data via residual maximum likelihood.",Most of our team members were familiar with exploratory data analysis and statistical modelling in R.,"Our team chose to explore the vocalic components of the German definite article ‘der’. We excluded tokens in which the definite article was ‘den’.   We included both the target trials, and also the preceding ‘competitor’ trials, referred to in this document as the ‘trigger’.

The acoustic variables analysed are given in table 1.  Those that are measured at the level of a vowel are analysed in two sets of models - models of the nucleus, and those at the offglide.

The following is a list of dependent variables we employed:

• The first formant measure at the midpoint of the target segment expressed as f1.
• The second formant measure at the midpoint of the target segment expressed as f2.
• The maximum amplitude of the target segment (i.e., /e/ or /@/)
• The mean pitch of the target segment expressed as f0.
• The duration of the target segment. 
• The combined duration of the nucleus /e/ and the schwa-offglide.
• The degree of formant movement between the nucleus and offglide, measured as the euclidean distance
• The ratio of the duration between the nucleus and the offglide.
• The duration of the target word.
• The duration of the pause between the end of the word and the start of the following word.
• The number of syllables in the sentence (either the trial or target, as relevant) divided by the summed word duration (excluding pauses)

These were tested across several stages of modelling. For our pre-registered model we focussed on acoustic characteristics of the nucleus. These models were not well-formed and we did not complete this modelling step, but abandoned it for models that have a better structure (described below). Vowel-specific factors were tested both for the nucleus (e) and the offglide (@). Three models were tested for properties of the combined nucleus/offglide. Finally, we tested the full word-level duration, and effects of the overall speech rate.

Our motivations for choosing variables associated with the /e/ and /ə/ vowels, of each preceding definite article ‘der’, is that we might expect changes in typicality to be signalled in surrounding words of the adjective+noun pairs, since a similar frequency effect is found in other multiword stretches. A similar phenomenon occurs in the English definite article ‘the’ where the vowel can experience production changes from /ə/ to /i:/ in situations where a speaker encounters a problem with the following utterance, such as when they are uncertain about pronunciation or word choice (Fox Tree & Clarke, 1997) . This is further supported by the findings in Jurafsky et al. (2001), Bell et al. (2009), and Tily et al. (2009) where acoustic features in an utterance are mediated by probabilistic relationships such as lexical frequency and predictability. As this analysis was fairly exploratory, we chose to investigate a wide range of potential acoustic factors.","Typicality: Our pre-registered model tested the three way Typicality Category supplied.  For other models we used a numeric predictor - the mean typicality from the typicality rating study. (P.typ_mean)

Condition: The trigger sentences were not part of the original design, and we coded them to a separate condition (T), so we tested a four level condition variable (T, NF, AF, ANF).

ScaledTrialNumber:  We scaled the trial number, and included this as a measure of how far through the experiment we were. 

syllablesPerMinute. The number of syllables in the clause (either the trigger or the target as appropriate), divided by the summed word duration.  Note: in our attempted pre-registered model, we used trialduration, as a speech rate control, and we switched to syllablesPerMinute for the other models.

We considered three way interactions between the first three variables, and included the speech rate variable as a control  (except in the speech rate model, where this became the dependent variable).

In the models of amplitude and pitch we also included a local control measure, which was the amplitude/pitch extracted from ‘den’ in the ‘den Wurfel’, immediately preceding the analysed ‘der’.


The first three independent variables are directly related to our hypotheses - firstly, that the typicality of the adjective+noun pairs and the combinations themselves could affect production of the vowel of the preceding definite article. Secondly this may be more pronounced in the adjective focus condition.  Thirdly, this phenomenon could decrease over time for each speaker.  In other words, the change in vowel quality/peripherality and duration may be less pronounced over time due to the normalising effects of regularly anticipating possible atypical adjective+noun pairs by the speakers as the experiment progresses. 

A control for speech rate is necessary, as duration effects will vary with speech rate, as may the other acoustic variables.  We preregistered that we would use the duration of the trial.  During modelling we realised that trials differed by number of syllables, and we switched to syllablesPerMinute for the final models as a more appropriate control.","The domain is indicated in the table above. Variables are defined at the domain of the nucleus, offglide, diphthong, or word.  The domain of speech rate is the local clause (either the trigger or the target clause in the trial).","We scaled and centred the continuous variables, trialnumber and trialduration (for the preregistered model), in order to help with model convergence.  These are in the columns scaledtrialnumber and scaledtrialduration.","For every variable, we remove outliers with 2.5sd +/- mean for each participant.   
We also applied a hard cut-off minimum of 800 to F2, as the 2.5sd criteria resulted in the inclusion of some unplausibly low values.",Significant pairwise ANOVA comparisons of minimally different lmer models.  We accepted a predictor as significant if its inclusion led to a significantly better model than a model that excluded it.,"As model fitting involves pairwise (ANOVA) anova comparison between minimally different models, in a backwards procedure, we used analysis of variance (ANOVA) to evaluate our models. The purpose of the ANOVA test was to compare two models and determine whether the removal of a variable significantly affected model performance.",We compared the explanatory power between our models using performance metrics from ANOVA.,"We preregistered a model that did not converge and had singularity errors, leading us to refine our model fitting, and adopt the numeric value of typicality rating.

Earlier modelling also showed the following:
(1) A significant effect of F2 on schwa.  Visualization of this effect revealed the problems with the low F2 values, leading us to impose a stricter F2 outlier criteria.
(2) Duration effects when speech rate was not properly controlled, leading us to adopt a more direct measure of speech rate, and analyse speech rate itself as a variable of interest."

The resulting multiple shorter audio files were batch-processed in the following order using a commercial program Myriad*: (1) Clear all meta-data and remove DC offset; (2) Fade-in and fade-out 10 ms on each side;(3) Add 200 ms of silence on each side; (4) Normalize to -23 LUFS. 

* Myriad 4.4.1 by Aurchitect Audio Software, LLC (discontinued). These basic procedures can be also achieved with batch processing in the open-source software Audacity (among others).

Next, we analyzed all the files using the ProPer workflow (https://osf.io/28ea5/). We used Praat to extract Intensity Tier, Pitch Object and Pitch Tier for each audio file. The Pitch Tiers were manually corrected by a group of annotators from the team to obtain reliable and smoothed F0 contours (10Hz smoothing in Praat). The Praat files (Intensity Tiers, Pitch Objects and Pitch Tiers) were then read into R using RStudio. The Pitch Tier files were read as the F0 time series; the Intensity Tier and Pitch Object files were read in order to calculate the periodic energy time series. The ProPer toolbox computes a prominence-related metric termed mass, which is based on the area under the periodic energy curve between two boundaries. ProPer also computes two pitch-related metrics, ∆F0 and synchrony, based on informative interactions between F0 and periodic energy.

For all statistical analysis, we used R and Rstudio. Bayesian mixed-modelling was performed using Stan via the brms library in R.
","The inferential results that are described in our report were obtained using Bayesian Mixed-Effects modeling with both Gaussian and log-normal likelihoods.


We also carried out hierarchical cluster analysis (linkage-criterion: complete linkage, distance matrix calculated on the basis of Euclidean distances).
","We were familiar with the ProPer analysis and the cluster analysis. In the team, people have various levels of expertise with mixed-modeling and / or Bayesian approaches. Overall, our collective expertise is relatively satisfactory but not perfect. On a 10 point likert-scale (1 being complete beginner in all aspects, e.g. both in mixed-modeling and in Bayesian approaches, 10 being high-level of expertise in both domains), we may estimate our global familiarity as close to 6/7, although it is distributed over various people with specific knowledge. Some of us were beginners in Bayesian analyses but received help from more experienced users in the team at various stages of the analysis. Some aspects of mixed-modeling that were crucial to reaching an appropriate level of data interpretation were also addressed during meetings.","The dependent variables were mass, deltaF0 and synchrony. 

1. Mass is the area under the periodic energy curve within each syllable. 

2. ∆F0 (DeltaF0) is the difference in F0 (Hz) between successive syllables (values taken from the center of periodic energy mass within each syllable) to account for the shape of the F0 curve across syllables. 

3. Synchrony measures the distance (in ms) between the center of periodic energy mass (CoM) and the tonal center of gravity (CoG) within each syllable, to account for the shape of the F0 curve within syllables. 

We chose these metrics as they allow for a holistic approach to measuring and describing speech prosody. 

For cluster analysis, time-series f0 measures were used as a dependent variable because they represent the f0 trajectory, unlike static measures such as f0 mean, f0 range, etc.
","We chose ‘typicality’ as the independent variable, because the research question concerned the ‘typicality’. The ‘medium’ level was not investigated thoroughly because there were not sufficient data points in this experimental condition.
We used the categorical distinction of 'typical' vs 'atypical', rather than the continuous mean values for typical also provided, as the latter did not in fact represent a continuous distribution of values, and therefore was essentially not informative beyond the binary/ternary distinction.

Defining ‘independent variable(s)’ does not apply to the cluster analysis itself. However, the clustering output was checked against the predictor ‘typicality’.
","The ProPer analysis was syllable-based. The syllable boundaries were semi-automatically determined in the ProPer algorithm, informed by both the minima across the periodic energy curve and the location of manually annotated boundaries from the textgrids (boundaries were manually added by a group of annotators from the team).

Although we looked at a relatively long stretch of the utterance (from ""auf"" to the end of ""ablegen""), we eventually targeted 4 syllables in each trial: the 2 stressed syllables and the 2 final syllables within the adjective and the following noun. For each syllable we computed the three ProPer metrics (mass, deltaF0 and synchrony).

Bayesian models included all three levels of Typicality for global estimation but the ‘medium’ level was not considered in the part that was dedicated to hypothesis testing: only specific comparisons between the ‘typical’ and ‘atypical’ conditions were estimated.

For clustering analysis, F0 measures were taken from noun-final syllables; 30 measures per syllable to acquire a reasonably high resolution trajectory. Octave jumps were corrected and if this correction did not succeed, the f0 contours were discarded.
","We used the ProPer workflow to obtain a smooth F0 contour that is modulated by the corresponding periodic energy curve. Periodic energy was computed in R from the Praat Pitch Object and Intensity Tier files. The periodic energy curve was log-transformed and smoothed. Four different floor values were used to fit the periodic energy curve of the different speakers in order to adjust the zero value of the log-transformed periodic energy time series. We used a 12Hz low-pass filter to smooth the final periodic energy curve and a 6Hz low-pass filter to smooth the final F0 curve. The variable names we used were 'smogPP_12Hz' for the periodic energy curve (smoothed with a 12Hz low-pass filtering), and 'f0_interp_stretch_smooth' for the F0 curve (smoothed with a 6Hz low-pass filter).

ProPer computes the three metrics from the two variables, 'smogPP_12Hz’ and 'f0_interp_stretch_smooth', and from landmarks that are derived from these two time series, such as the center of periodic energy mass (CoM) and the tonal center of gravity (CoG):

1. We normalized mass by computing the relative difference between the masses in each utterance, yielding the variable 'mass_rel'.

2. We normalized DeltaF0 by dividing the raw values by the F0 range of that speaker across the different analyzed trials, yielding the variable 'DeltaF0_rel'.

3. We normalized synchrony by dividing the raw values with the duration of the containing syllable, yielding the variable 'sync_rel'.

Only relative measures were used as Dependent Variables. No further transformations were performed for the inference part.

For clustering analysis, F0 time-series measures were speaker-corrected using standardisation (Rose, 1987; doi: 10.1016/0167-6393(87)90009-4).



","We used a subset of the data in two phases. In both phases we analyzed the targets (from ""auf"" to the end of ""ablegen"") only for the noun focus (NF) condition. We excluded the utterances with errors as commented by the MSA coordinators in the textgrid. 

In Phase 1, we controlled word length in the targets; we selected targets with a disyllabic adjective followed by a disyllabic noun. In Phase 2 we added two targets containing words with more than two syllables, ""o.ran.ge(.)n(en) Trau.ben"" and ""gel.ben Zit.ro.ne"", to mitigate the potential confound, the syllable structure, found in Phase 1. In Phase 1, all ‘typical’ noun phrases were found to end with a closed syllable (Wal.nuss, Boh.nen) whilst all ‘atypical’ noun phrases ended with an open syllable (Möh.re, Kir.sche, Gur.ke). 


For cluster analysis, Clustering was applied using R and subsetting of the data was done following the procedure referenced in the report. From the total number of NF syllables, 364 were clustered.

In the Bayesian modeling part, no data were excluded. For each item, 4 syllables were entered into the analysis (Penultimate syllable / Adjective, Final syllable / Adjective, Penultimate syllable / Noun, Final syllable / Noun). Relative expressions of Mass, Synchrony and DeltaF0 were investigated as Dependent Variables. Initial explorations of distributional properties for each dependent variable were performed in order to target possible distribution fits for the modeling, which should limit the impact of possible extreme observations that may not fit the selected likelihood. Although all 3 levels of typicality were included in the analyses, the ‘medium’ level was excluded from specific hypothesis testing for simplification (and due to a paucity of data for this condition), even though at least some partial investigations seemed to be in line with conclusions that were drawn from the ‘atypical’ condition.

","For Bayesian modeling, our criteria were based on the computation of 95%-credible intervals and posterior probabilities for each specific effect.

For clustering analysis, an evaluation method to find the ideal number of clusters was applied. This method is based on comparing information cost measures for several clustering rounds. We obtained the lowest information cost value for a cluster analysis with 6 clusters. 
","For each syllable, we tested the unidirectional posterior probability that, given our model, priors, and data, the estimate size is greater than zero (with the same sign, therefore in the same direction). The estimate is measured by subtracting the ‘Typical’ from the ‘Atypical’ condition, a negative sign indicating a lowering of the measurement in the Atypical condition with respect to the Typical condition.

The main effect which we focused on in our analysis, using a log-normal likelihood, is observed on the Noun Final syllable for “relative Mass”: Estimate: -0.59 [-0.69, -0.49].

The effect size as estimated by Cohen's d on the posterior distribution is -2.23.

","The unit for the effect size is a standardized mean difference. These were computed from the posterior distributions for each model and each specific comparison
","See answer to an earlier question on the observations excluded (explaining the rationale of phase 2).

An intermediate phase in the analysis influenced the choice of the main Dependent Variable. Indeed, we first looked at patterns of the Typicality effect on the 4 target syllables (corresponding to the noun and adjective in the sequence) as concerns the various measurements of interest (Synchrony, DeltaF0 and Mass). Our analysis was first focused on Mass, as it was the only measurement for which we observed a difference that seemed to be potentially systematic. However, it turned out in the subsequent analyses that some effects occurred on the other two Dependent Variables (DeltaF0 and synchrony) as well, although these were very small, not on the same syllables and with various effect sizes. However no changes in actual measurements or type of analysis applied were made. As these effects were so small and considering the computational power required by Bayesian modeling, due to time constraints, we did not pursue further aspects of the analyses for these two  other variables at this point (e.g. comparing models with varying likelihoods in order to select the best one as was done for Mass).

","As our independent variable, we only chose typicality. In our inferential statistics, we used both speaker and words. Typicality was used as our outcome in the PCA and in random forests. Within the latter, we specifically chose the first 20 speakers to be part of the training set, while the remaining 20 speakers were in the testing set. Typicality was also chosen as the outcome variable for Bayesian modeling.
","For all of our dependent variables (acoustic metrics), we decided to do the analyses on a word level, first by identifying the adjective and then the noun in the NF context.

We assessed accuracy of the classification model using separate training and testing sets, then an AUC-based evaluation of the performance. We used the sensitivity, specificity, recall, precision and the F-measure on the training set and only accuracy and the AUC value for the testing set. In addition, and to try to evaluate any specific differences emerging from the three levels of typicality, we used the confusion matrix to identify accuracies and confusions in classification, in addition to the cumulative gains and AUC-ROC curves.

Since dB is a logarithmic scale, calculating the difference actually represents a ratio. We based our decision on the following paper:

Also this dependent variable gives very nice shape of the data (like a Gaussian as opposed to doing a ratio of the intensity in dB which was giving a skewed distribution).
","The predictors we selected are:
-	The condition since we expected it to have a high influence on the prosody of the vowel (we expected the adjective to be more stressed in the AF condition than in the NF condition).
-	The typicality. We decided to use the mean typicality (mean_typ).

The effect is found in the AF condition only. It means that the more typical is   the target_colour the higher will be the relative intensity of the stressed vowel vs the rest of the sentence. 
","I’d say it’s in dB by unit of typicality (typicality varying from 0 to 1, 0 for low typicality and 1 for high typicality, since we divided the typ_mean variable by 100).","Not really.

Textgrids were hand-labeled in Praat.",We used linear mixed-effects models with random effects for speakers.,Very familiar.,"Based on previous findings that less predictable words are hyperarticulated relative to more predictable words (e.g., Liebermann, 1967), our driving hypothesis was that typicality might condition hyperarticulation. Specifically, less typical words (which are less predictable in their contexts) were expected to be hyperarticulated relative to more typical words (which are more predictable in their contexts). Or, conversely, more typical words were expected to be reduced relative to less typical words.
Taking a multidimensional perspective on hyperarticulation, we looked at both word duration and vowel space areas for stressed vowels in the color words. We chose to analyze the color words rather than the nouns because they are consistent throughout the experiment. 
We predicted that less typical words would be longer and would have more peripheral vowel qualities, yielding bigger vowel space areas, relative to more typical words.
We also looked at F1 and F2 to see whether there were any vowel quality differences not captured by the vowel space area measurement.","Typicality--we predicted that the color words would be hyperarticulated in atypical context compared to typical context
Vowel--we controlled for expected differences in vowel quality across vowels
Gender--we controlled for expected differences in vowel quality by gender
Speaker--we included random intercepts for each speaker to control for individual differences","Duration--Because several of the targets had vowels adjacent to sonorants, making precise segmentation difficult, we decided not to use vowel durations.  Instead, we used full word durations (which were compared across typicality conditions). 
F1 and F2 measures were made at 5 points across the approximately segmented vowel, and points 2 (25% of the way through the vowel) and 4 (75% of the way through the vowel) were analyzed. Since the vowel boundaries were not precise (due to the adjacent sonorants), points 2 and 4 were not at 25% and 75% exactly, but they always captured points early and late in the vowel respectively. Since one of the vowels was a diphthong (/au/), the early and late measures represent values from the nucleus and glide for that vowel.
Vowel space areas (VSA) were calculated for each speaker for each condition (typical, medium, or atypical) using the vowelMeansPolygonArea function in the PhonR package in R. That function calculated the area for a polygon in the F1/F2 vowel space defined by the 5 vowels in the color terms: /y/, /e/, /a/, /au/, and /o/, in that order.

We used categorical typicality as the mean typicality had very few values to run as a continuous variable.

We focused on just the colour and object as we thought this is where the variation would best show.

","We decided to look at three measures in order to approach the given research question: 1) Intensity in dB of the entire word (for colour and object), 2) F0 as an acoustic correlate of what is perceived as pitch (looking at only the stressed vowel in both colour and object) and 3) vowel duration (again of only the stressed vowels in both the colour and object levels). 

 Key for this analysis was the reduction of words down to only those of interest (object and colour) and the creation of a new two-level column `(col_obj)` which identified words as being either `colour` or `object`. The column `voice_type` was also added to the data frame which contained a two-level factor assigning each speaker as either having `low` or `high` pitch. Both authors coded the speakers auditorily and were in agreement for all 30 speakers. F0 means and ranges were also checked for each group with a cut off of <150Hz (~12 Semitones) for the lower group and >150 Hz for the higher group.

Col_obj was manually coded in R as either colour or object.","For Intensity in dB, we squared the predictor variable (Mean_dB^2) as the distribution was skewed left.

As the f0 residuals were bimodal, we cut the data into measures above and below 150Hz (~10 Semitones) where the two local peaks in the distributions were.

This includes the target vowel of diphthong and any sonorant codas (/l, r, n/). All measurements were extracted automatically with a Praat script, except for the Formant Distance. For that, we first measured with Praat F1 and F2 from a time point 1/3rd of the way through the rhyme, then converted those into Z-scores for each speaker (Lobanov's method), and then measured the Euclidean distance of each vowel from the speaker's mean F1+F2 point.","We converted the F0 values to Semi-Tones, using the formula provided by Reetz & Jongman (2020). We used 75 Hz as the baseline for this calculation. 
We also converted F1 + F2 measures to a general measure of ""Formant Distance"" according to the method described above.","We excluded items that were labeled as mistakes in the provided textgrids and any items that had mistakes, disfluencies, or noise.
We also excluded from the Formant Distance any items whose F1 or F2 z-scores were greater than 2, as this enabled us to eliminate the most obvious cases where the Praat formant tracker had missed measuring one of the formants. 
Finally, for F0 (ST), we set the lower end of the pitch range at 75 Hz for male speakers, and 100 Hz for female speakers. This enabled us to avoid the most obvious cases of pitch halving in the automatically generated F0 data.",p-values < .05,"We tested the effects of typicality on four different acoustic measures and found no significant effect for any of them. In those cases, there is no ""effect size"" to report. 
However, we also tested the effects of focus on adjectives and nouns in the ""atypical"" condition. These tests yielded significant results for all of our dependent measures, generally in the direction of greater acoustic prominence for focused items.

Speakers in many languages use pitch modifications as a phonetic cue to draw the listener’s attention to a certain part of the utterance. For example, for an English speaker, the pitch maximum in ‘bananas’ in the utterance “I bought bananas” will normally be higher in a contrastive focus context (e.g., “I bought bananas, not pears”) than in the non-contrastive declarative counterpart. I believe participants in this study could use a similar process to mark adjectives that appear in atypical adjective + noun combinations. For example, the atypicality of the adjective ‘rot’ (Eng., ‘red’) in relation to the noun ‘Gurke’ (Eng., ‘cucumber’) could prompt speakers to mark this atypicality by using higher pitch in the modifier adjective.","The within-subject factor is the typicality level between the target adjective and the noun (three levels: typical, medium, atypical). This factor was chosen as the independent variable since the research question seeks to answer if typicality variations have an effect on the acoustics of the utterance.","Pitch was operationalized as the pitch maxima (in Hz) in adjectives of NF adjective + noun combinations. 
Typicality was operationalized as having three levels: atypical, medium, typical, based on norming and production studies supplied by MSA project.",N/A,"Target adjectives were marked as containing errors in the following circumstances:
o	A pitch track was not visible at all.
o	Creaky voice inside the target adjective affected the pitch track.
o	The pitch track contained unusual excursions, such as sudden shifts or isolated spikes.
o	The trial contained an annotation in the ‘notes’ tier, as provided by the MSA project. In most cases, the annotation in these cases was simply ‘error’, but sometimes ‘hesitation break’ or ‘structure’ were also used.  Since I do not know enough German to evaluate the error gravity or type for these trials, I decided to mark all of them as errors. 
All target adjectives with any kind of error were subsequently excluded from analysis.

During analysis, seven participants were excluded:
o	In order to preserve representativeness of each target adjective, speakers whose mean pitch score on any typicality level resulted from less than six original scores were excluded from analysis. This process eliminated three speakers.
o	Outliers were identified, using identify.outliers(), which determines limits for outliers by multiplying the interquartile range (IQR) by 1.5. This identified 13 outlier data points (that is, 13 mean pitch scores), 12 of which belonged to four participants. That is, these four participants had outlier scores in every typicality level.

This included the following: 
-	Creating a textgrid tier below the existing tiers to specify the Det+Adj combinations to be analyzed. We chose to analyze the Det+Adj combination because the Det often included transitions that were difficult to segment from the adjective (e.g., “der”).
-	Finding the boundaries for the Det+Adj was done in Praat by hand by multiple (n=6) coders. Each coder was assigned to annotate all trials for 5 participants and the first three trials for all other participants. Boundaries were created at zero crossings using large acoustic/auditory cues. Boundaries that were unable to be detected were flagged, and the team lead made a final decision as to the appropriate boundary, and whether to discard the trial if necessary. All trials that were flagged as errors in the original Praat files were discarded.

The Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) was used to create word-level alignments.,Bayesian mixed-effects regression model with lognormal distribution for the outcome variable and a log link function.,I have used this technique before and have a good amount of experience with it.,"The analysis looks at the effect of the typicality of adjective + noun combinations in German (e.g. yellow banana) on their prosody, focusing specifically on the duration of the adjective as measured in seconds. This focus is motivated by two facts. First, the predictability of a word based on its preceding and following neighbours is known to have a strong, highly replicable and cross-linguistically robust effect on its duration (Bell et al. 2009, Seyfarth 2014, Tang & Shaw 2021). Arguably, the typicality of an adjective + noun sequence is closely related to the backward predictability of the adjective based on the noun, and the forward predictability of the noun based on the adjective. This link between typicality and predictability suggests that word duration is an ideal measure to investigate typicality effects. Second, the focus is on the duration of the adjective for the simple reason that while each adjective occurred in all three typicality conditions (atypi-cal, medium, typical), the nouns each only occurred in a single typicality condition. Be-cause of this, the phonological makeup of the nouns (which is inevitably the strongest predictor of word duration) is confounded with the typicality condition in which they appear. Any duration measure that involves the nouns will be affected by this confound, and even sophisticated controls for word duration (e.g. baseline durations based on speech synthesis; Seyfarth 2014) are unlikely to fully resolve this issue. Therefore, the focus here is on the adjectives only.",The categorical typicality variable was chosen as the fixed effect independent variable. The rationale was simply that this seemed to align the most closely with the experimental design.,"The dependent variable was the duration of the adjective (the entire word) as measured in seconds. The independent variable, as noted above, was simply ""typicality"" as operationalised in the original data (atypical, medium, typical).","No transformation was applied before entering the duration values into the model – however, the lognormal model does perform a sort of a log transform internally through the link function. The rationale for using the lognormal model is that duration measurements are bounded at 0 and therefore follow a skewed distribution.","Only typical / atypical combinations were examined (medium excluded), and only in the NF condition. Tokens from utterances with any text on the notes tier (typically ""error"") were excluded, as were tokens where there was any pause between the adjective and noun as determined by the forced aligner.",The decision was based on Bayesian credible intervals.,"Cohen’s D: –0.028, CrI [–0.58,0.51] (typical has a lower estimated duration than atypical; raw values in log duration: –0.012 with a 95% CrI of [–0.256, 0.196])",Cohen's D,"There were very few revisions as the analysis was designed with minimising researcher degrees of freedom in mind (within reasonable limits, of course!). One change that took place after inspecting preliminary data was to add an alternative pronunciation of ""orangen"" to the forced aligner and re-align the textgrids. The final model also had to be pared down slightly to address divergent transitions (but, as noted in the text & analysis script, the original non-convergent model produces the same results).

I also originally wanted to analyse the duration of the entire adjective + noun sequence. After extracting & wrangling the duration data, I realised that this was not feasible due to the fact that each noun only appears in a single typicality condition, and therefore typicality is confounded with the phonological makeup of nouns. This was, however, before running the statistical analysis, and it did not lead to any changes in the data extraction / data wrangling process."

Audio was aligned to text using the Montreal Forced Aligner with the german_mfa dictionary and acoustic model. Statistical analysis and data visualization was conducted in R.","We analyzed the data using linear mixed effects regression under a Bayesian approach with the rstanarm package in R (Goodrich et al. 2020; R Core Team 2021). We used treatment coding for Condition, setting the reference level at NF based on the conjecture that conditions which involved focus specifically on the adjective should lead to higher pitch ranges than the case where focus was on the noun. We used custom contrasts for Typicality to allow us to compare Atypical category to the Typical category as well as compare the Atypical category to the mean of the other categories. Finally, we used treatment coding for Category, setting the reference level on NONFOOD because the expectation is that non-foods come in a wider variety of colors. We began by fitting a maximal model justified by the experimental design: main effects for Typicality, Category, and Condition as well as all interactions. Random Effects included random intercepts for Object, Colour, and Speaker and random slopes matching the fixed effects (except for any slopes dealing with Category for the Object random intercept, as it already captures the notion of Category. We fit this model using weakly informative Gaussian priors that were autoscaled by rstanarm. We set the adapt_delta parameter, which penalizes larger step transitions, to a conservative value of 0.999. We sampled four chains from the posterior distribution with 2000 steps equally split between warmup and sampling. Model fit was assessed using visual posterior predictive checks and leave-one-out cross validation with a Pareto k diagnostic set at a threshold of 0.7. We then simplified the model beginning by removing the random slopes and higher-order terms; we determined a stopping point based on a comparison of ELPD (expected log pointwise predictive density) values.",I have advanced intermediate knowledge of this technique,"The research question is whether the acoustic profile of an utterance with an typical referent differs from one with a more typical referent, so we began by searching for phonetic and phonological studies that focused on the manipulation of predictability and/or typicality in German. A cursory examination of the literature suggests that contrastive (narrow) focus in German is marked by a rising tone with a low boundary tone (L+H* L%; cf. Weber et al., 2006; Fery & Wang, 2018) as opposed to a flat high tone in broad focus utterances, and this pitch accent is also seen in unexpected or less common adjectives. We operationalize this hypothesized difference using pitch range within the adjective as a dependent variable. Specifically, we hypothesize that pitch range should be higher within the adjective for utterances where that adjective is atypical and the utterance is focused.","We included Condition, Typicality, and Category as independent variables in the model. We expected main effects of Condition (AF >= ANF > NF) and Typicality (Atypical > Medium >= Typical) as well as an interaction between Typicality and Category (e.g., Atypical foods should show wider pitch excursions than atypical nonfoods, because foods are much more likely than nonfoods to have one canonical color).","We selected f0 range within the adjective, assuming that this would index pitch excursion. Given that the adjective appears first and carries the majority of the pragmatic value in terms of typicality/surprisal, we restricted our analysis to this area specifically.We used treatment coding for Condition, setting the reference level at NF based on the conjecture that conditions which involved focus specifically on the adjective should lead to higher pitch ranges than the case where focus was on the noun.

Given the large pool of acoustic measures, we expect collinearity and considerable correlation among the acoustic measures; thus, it is less valid to generate individual statistic models on treating each acoustic measure as dependent variables as a function of typicality. We argue that, based on the t-SNE visualizations and density plots, acoustic measures should be analyzed holistically as a group. Thus, we employed binary logistic regression with mixed-effects models to investigate the contributions of various acoustic measures on establishing a certain typicality category. Note that this model assumes a perception-production link during speech production, such that speakers would make an effort to produce and signal a less typical word combination to the listeners in a conversational setting. Further, there is a designed competitor in the different experimental conditions, so we expect speakers to actively distinguish between a less typical and a typical object and to convey the differences to be perceptible.","F0, H1*, H2*, H4*, H2K*, H5K*, H1*-H2*, H2*-H4*, H4*-2K*, H2K*-H5K*, cepstral peak prominence (CPP), harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR05-35), subharmonics-to-harmonics ratio (SHR), energy, and strength of excitation (soe).

All other measurements were normalized to Z-score with regard to the means of all the samples produced by individual speakers. These normalizations make it possible for comparisons with the same unit: the numeric values are relative to the sample distribution of measurements taken from the speaker.

Some of us are moderately familiar with the usage of K-means clustering and Random Forest classification on this sort of data; two of the four members have previously successfully used such techniques in previous research.,"For the k-means clustering analysis, the dependent variable was pitch accent type (as determined by PoLaR labels), the rationale being that different pitch accents should signal different meanings with respect to information structure (e.g., which words are semantically focused).

The primary goal was to run a random forest classification model, for which the dependent variable was the focus condition of the original experiment. The rationale was that we hoped that intonational information should be reliably conveyed and modulated by focus condition.
","For the k-means clustering analysis, the independent variables were normed f0-slopes (i.e. PoLaR “Levels” per second) that defined the close-copy of the f0 movements (as created by PoLaR labels)

For the random forest classification model, the independent variables were acoustic variables of the utterance (guided by PoLaR labels; e.g., f0 min (Hz), max (Hz), f0 range size (Hz)) as well as variables having to do with prominence (which word/words in relevant region is/are pitch-accented, and which types of pitch accent are used for each word type).
","Most of the operationalization was done according to PoLaR annotation conventions (guiding pitch range size, f0 turning points, and normed pitch values). Given the experimental design, we focused our analysis on the region of each utterance containing the determiner, adjective, and noun in the second half.
",We applied no transformations (though PoLaR annotations essentially transform f0 values to scaled/normed pitch levels 1-5).,"We excluded any observation in which the adjective-noun pairing was not “medium”, because only for “medium” typicality observations were there an equal number of observations across focus types.

Additionally, we excluded the files that were labelled as errors by the original labeller. We also excluded files where there were major disfluencies (involving the repetition of several words): MS’s 1st trial, CG’s 66th trial, and PB’s 31st trial.
","We examined the confusion matrix for the random forest classification, specifying that an error rate of less than 25% would indicate reliable performance. To decide whether a factor was a good predictor, we visually examined the relative importance of the factors in the classification model, and removed low-ranking variables while checking that the error rate in the confusion matrix did not go down.",N/A for this analysis.,N/A for this analysis.,"For utterances with more than two F0 turning points, we had to reassess how to calculate slope to capture multiple dynamic changes. In the end, we calculated a sum of slopes, which does have the limitation of not capturing differences between flat f0 contours and contours that both fall and rise. Additionally, rises comprised of two moderate excursions cannot be distinguished from a single extreme excursion."

This process allowed us to compare entire utterances across all speakers and all utterances (if required). We approached this from a bottom-up perspective, as we had no strong hypotheses about what we would find and the research question we were asked was very general. We only considered the NF condition, as this was the only condition that appeared to address the research question",Typicality differences between adj-noun pairs in the NF condition (because our DV was distances between two utterances/ adjectives). We used the median typicality ratings from the norming experiment as this allowed us to keep the data continuous,"MFCCs and f0 were extracted at 10ms intervals across the entire utterance (we broke this down into the constituent parts of the utterances as well, to allow us to just look at the adjective). All of the data for each utterance/adjective were pooled to create a statistical model for that utterance/adjective","The raw data were (1) converted to a probability distribution using GMMs, (2) Kullback-Leibler divergences were calculated to measure the distance between utterances/adjectives (i.e. how different they are from each other) - this was done within speaker, (3) KL-divergences were z-scored within-speaker to normalise across speakers","We didn't remove outliers, but in retrospect, we might have taken the log of the normalised KL-divergences as the distributions aren't particularly normal",p-values,"MFCCs based on the whole utterance: -1.195e-03 (estimate) ±0.001 (95% confidence interval)

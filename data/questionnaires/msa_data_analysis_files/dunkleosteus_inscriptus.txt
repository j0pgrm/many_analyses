Which software did you use for the processing of the recordings and extraction of acoustic measurements? Please indicate all pieces of software that were used, and specify what was accomplished with each. For example: "Filtering of the recordings was done using the Matlab signal processing toolbox, while the extraction of acoustic measurements (f0, duration, formants, CoG) was accomplished with Praat."


Matlab: file manipulation, signal processing, TextGrid extraction and manipulation, speech auditing
BAS WebServices / WebMAUS: signal conditioning, phonemic transcription, forced alignment, acoustic segmentation, TextGrid generation
R: data wrangling, data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Which analytical/statistical technique(s) did you employ to answer the research question? Please, indicate the name of the techniques and describe specific details if necessary. For example, "We run Bayesian mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution of the outcome variable". Details about variables and parameters will be asked in later questions.


Linear Mixed-Effects models with NHST
Bayesian Mixed-Effects models with ROPE analysis



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How familiar are you with the analytical/statistical technique you employed?


Quite familiar with LMEs and NHST; relatively new to Bayesian Mixed Effects modelling



------------------------------------------------------------------------



To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the dependent variable(s) (outcome or measured or latent variable), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple dependent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Duration of target noun phrase and associated constituents. Duration was chosen because it is easier to measure more consistently than other phonetic correlates of prosody, because it can be measured automatically, and because the analysis method I've proposed based on duration metrics is perfectly reproducable.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the independent variable(s) (predictors), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple independent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Condition, Typicality, Speaker ID, target_name, target_colour. The first two are intrinsic to the research question and study design; the last three are the major influences on duration.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How did you operationalise your dependent and independent variables? For example, if you choose f0 as a variable, specify from which speech domain it was extracted (for example: the phrase, the word, the syllable, the vowel, etc.), whether you extracted a summary statistic over a larger domain or a concrete value at a specific or relative point in time. For categorical variables (like age, gender, etc.), specify the levels/categories, how they are operationalised and the rationale behind the categorisation.


Duration was calculated from acoustically segmented speech annotations generated by forced alignment of each trial. Duration was determined for the entire utterance and each major synatactic consistuent, down to the level of the individual words, quantified as a continuous variable in seconds, quantized to 10ms. All other variables were treated as they were presented in the Trial lists and the description of the study design.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What transformation (if any) were applied to the variables? Please, be as specific as possible by indicating for each variable that has been transformed the name of the variable as found in the dataset and the formula/operation that has been applied to it. For example: "We log transformed the F0 values, which are found in the column 'log_f0' of our data frame."


Absolute durations were calculated for each word and constituent of interest. Two additional metrics were derived from these data: relative duration of noun and adjective, calculated as ratios of the total durations of the Determiner phrase that contains them.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Were any observations excluded? If so, which criteria did you follow for the exclusion? For example: "We excluded values that were +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean."


All Trials flagged as 'error' in the original Praat notes tier were discarded.
All additional trials observed to contain production errors or large hesitation pauses were excluded.
All trials that could not be accurately acoustically segmented were excluded.
All trials with durations of constituents shorter than mean-2 s.d and longer than mean +3 s.d were excluded, and additional outliers were excluded based on constituent-specific determinations of extrema and non-linearities identified in quintile-quintile plots.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What criteria did you use to decide on an answer to the research question? For example, the decision could have been based on p-values for particular predictors and/or interactions, on Bayesian posterior distributions, or confidence/credible intervals, etc...


Bayesian posterial distributions with respect to Regions of Practical Equivalence



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the size of the effect for the research question? Please, specify the magnitude and direction of the effect size, along with the 95% confidence (or credible) interval in the following format: estimate [low interval, high interval].


Relative duration of target N/DP,    Atyp -> Typ:  -0.02  [-0.03, 0.00]
Relative duration of target Adj/DP, Atyp -> Typ:   0.01  [-0.01, 0.03]



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What unit is your effect size in (i.e., Hedges' G, standardized mean difference, etc.)?


Ratio of durations [0..1]



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Often we do not anticipate possible road blocks during our analyses. Did you encounter scenarios in which you had to revise an earlier analytical decision at a later stage, e.g. change a measurement after you have statistically analyzed (parts of) the data? If so, please briefly describe the situation.


Recording noise adversly affected the accuracy of forced alignment for some speakers to a greater extent than was aparent from analyzing the first five speakers. Noise attenuation parameters were subesuently adjusted in WebMAUS to improve alignment, and the first five speakers were re-analyzed.

The set of duration measurements extracted from TextGrids with a Matlab script were later found to be incomplete, and one constituent was mis-labelled. These issues were corrected in R.

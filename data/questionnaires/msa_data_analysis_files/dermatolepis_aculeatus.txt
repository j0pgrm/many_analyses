Which software did you use for the processing of the recordings and extraction of acoustic measurements? Please indicate all pieces of software that were used, and specify what was accomplished with each. For example: "Filtering of the recordings was done using the Matlab signal processing toolbox, while the extraction of acoustic measurements (f0, duration, formants, CoG) was accomplished with Praat."


The extraction of acoustic measurements (minimum pitch, high pitch, mean pitch) was accomplished with Praat.

Which analytical/statistical technique(s) did you employ to answer the research question? Please, indicate the name of the techniques and describe specific details if necessary. For example, "We run Bayesian mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution of the outcome variable". Details about variables and parameters will be asked in later questions.


We run mixed-effects models.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How familiar are you with the analytical/statistical technique you employed?


Very familiar.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the dependent variable(s) (outcome or measured or latent variable), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple dependent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


We picked three dependent variables: maximum high pitch of nouns, maximum high pitch of adjectives, and maximum high pitch of the whole phrase. The rationale behind these variables is that we assume that atypical utterances would have the highest maximum pitch values, typical utterances would have the lowest maximum pitch values, and medium typical utterances would fall in between. Thus, we chose the maximum high pitch of the target tokens to examine the data.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the independent variable(s) (predictors), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple independent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


As  the Noun Focus condition contained stimuli with all three levels of typicality,  we picked typicality as our independent variables in the subset data created for Noun Focus condition only.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How did you operationalise your dependent and independent variables? For example, if you choose f0 as a variable, specify from which speech domain it was extracted (for example: the phrase, the word, the syllable, the vowel, etc.), whether you extracted a summary statistic over a larger domain or a concrete value at a specific or relative point in time. For categorical variables (like age, gender, etc.), specify the levels/categories, how they are operationalised and the rationale behind the categorisation.


We extracted the high pitch (f0) for nouns, adjectives, and phrases.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What transformation (if any) were applied to the variables? Please, be as specific as possible by indicating for each variable that has been transformed the name of the variable as found in the dataset and the formula/operation that has been applied to it. For example: "We log transformed the F0 values, which are found in the column 'log_f0' of our data frame."


We normalized all the values of each dependent variables by scaling them around their means. This was done via scale function in R.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Were any observations excluded? If so, which criteria did you follow for the exclusion? For example: "We excluded values that were +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean."


Thirteen token adjective-noun pairs were identified as containing errors and were excluded. Two contained mispronunciations (e.g., [t]irsche instead of [k]irsche). Eight had false starts, where either the adjective or noun was partially pronounced, and then the speaker stopped and restarted (e.g., roten Gurk- Gurke). Finally, three were excluded for recasting, where the speaker said part of either the adjective or noun, stopped, and then re-started or changed the phrase (e.g. says ‘gelben Bohne’ and then corrects to ‘gelben Erbsen’.) 
There were some trials that were already marked as errors on the TextGrids that we chose not to exclude. These included hesitation breaks; although it seems possible that such a delay might signal an atypical word combination, it is irrelevant for the examination of pitch modulations, which was the focus of our analyses. Therefore we did not exclude these trials. We also did not exclude trials in which there was an error but the error did not relate to the pronunciation of the adjective-noun pair, and trials in which there was background noise, but the words were comprehensible and the pitch measurements were unaffected by the noise.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What criteria did you use to decide on an answer to the research question? For example, the decision could have been based on p-values for particular predictors and/or interactions, on Bayesian posterior distributions, or confidence/credible intervals, etc...


The decision was based on the significant level of the dependent variables in each model.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the size of the effect for the research question? Please, specify the magnitude and direction of the effect size, along with the 95% confidence (or credible) interval in the following format: estimate [low interval, high interval].


We did not report it.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What unit is your effect size in (i.e., Hedges' G, standardized mean difference, etc.)?


We did not report it.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Often we do not anticipate possible road blocks during our analyses. Did you encounter scenarios in which you had to revise an earlier analytical decision at a later stage, e.g. change a measurement after you have statistically analyzed (parts of) the data? If so, please briefly describe the situation.


No, we did not.

Which software did you use for the processing of the recordings and extraction of acoustic measurements? Please indicate all pieces of software that were used, and specify what was accomplished with each. For example: "Filtering of the recordings was done using the Matlab signal processing toolbox, while the extraction of acoustic measurements (f0, duration, formants, CoG) was accomplished with Praat."


Segmentation of the data was conducted in Praat. The team member created an additional interval tier in each of the received text grid files and segmented and marked on it the vowels of the nouns in the NF trials.

Which analytical/statistical technique(s) did you employ to answer the research question? Please, indicate the name of the techniques and describe specific details if necessary. For example, "We run Bayesian mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution of the outcome variable". Details about variables and parameters will be asked in later questions.

How familiar are you with the analytical/statistical technique you employed?

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the dependent variable(s) (outcome or measured or latent variable), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple dependent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Vowel duration. The reason for choosing vowels for the investigation of the effects of typically was based on previous research (Bell et al., 2002; Bell et al., 2009; Bybee & De Souza, 2019; Jurafsky et al., 2000; Seyfarth, 2014). that predictability has an influence on vowels' qualitative and quantitative characteristics.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the independent variable(s) (predictors), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple independent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Typicality. Speakers are often overinformative, i.e. they use referring expressions that are more specific than necessary. This redundancy has been argued to facilitate object identification and more efficient communication (Arts et al. 2011, Paraboni et al. 2007, Rubio-Fernandez 2016). For example, Degen et al. (2020) show that modifiers that are less typical for a given referent (e.g. a blue banana) are more likely to be used in an overinformative scenario (e.g. when there is just one banana). As a result, atypical objects would be used in a more overinformative scenario than typical objects.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How did you operationalise your dependent and independent variables? For example, if you choose f0 as a variable, specify from which speech domain it was extracted (for example: the phrase, the word, the syllable, the vowel, etc.), whether you extracted a summary statistic over a larger domain or a concrete value at a specific or relative point in time. For categorical variables (like age, gender, etc.), specify the levels/categories, how they are operationalised and the rationale behind the categorisation.


Average vowel duration was computed by averaging individual vowel durations per word for that specific speaker in that condition. For instance, <tomate> in an atypical condition has three vowels 'o', 'a' and 'e' with the duration being 0.05, 0.06, 0.05, so the average duration would be 0.053.
Typicality was operationalised as a three-level factor: typical, medium and atypical.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What transformation (if any) were applied to the variables? Please, be as specific as possible by indicating for each variable that has been transformed the name of the variable as found in the dataset and the formula/operation that has been applied to it. For example: "We log transformed the F0 values, which are found in the column 'log_f0' of our data frame."


No transformations were conducted.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Were any observations excluded? If so, which criteria did you follow for the exclusion? For example: "We excluded values that were +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean."


No data exclusion



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What criteria did you use to decide on an answer to the research question? For example, the decision could have been based on p-values for particular predictors and/or interactions, on Bayesian posterior distributions, or confidence/credible intervals, etc...


The decision was conducted based on credible intervals and if it crossed or overlapped with 0.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the size of the effect for the research question? Please, specify the magnitude and direction of the effect size, along with the 95% confidence (or credible) interval in the following format: estimate [low interval, high interval].


Atypical vs typical: 0.00[-0.04 0.05]



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What unit is your effect size in (i.e., Hedges' G, standardized mean difference, etc.)?


Cohen's d



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Often we do not anticipate possible road blocks during our analyses. Did you encounter scenarios in which you had to revise an earlier analytical decision at a later stage, e.g. change a measurement after you have statistically analyzed (parts of) the data? If so, please briefly describe the situation.


No

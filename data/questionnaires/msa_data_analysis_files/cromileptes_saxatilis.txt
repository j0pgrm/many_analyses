Which software did you use for the processing of the recordings and extraction of acoustic measurements? Please indicate all pieces of software that were used, and specify what was accomplished with each. For example: "Filtering of the recordings was done using the Matlab signal processing toolbox, while the extraction of acoustic measurements (f0, duration, formants, CoG) was accomplished with Praat."


Praat was used for editing textgrids and extracting word duration measurements. The Montreal Forced Aligner (MFA) was used to create word-level alignments.

Which analytical/statistical technique(s) did you employ to answer the research question? Please, indicate the name of the techniques and describe specific details if necessary. For example, "We run Bayesian mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution of the outcome variable". Details about variables and parameters will be asked in later questions.

How familiar are you with the analytical/statistical technique you employed?


I have used this technique before and have a good amount of experience with it.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the dependent variable(s) (outcome or measured or latent variable), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple dependent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


The analysis looks at the effect of the typicality of adjective + noun combinations in German (e.g. yellow banana) on their prosody, focusing specifically on the duration of the adjective as measured in seconds. This focus is motivated by two facts. First, the predictability of a word based on its preceding and following neighbours is known to have a strong, highly replicable and cross-linguistically robust effect on its duration (Bell et al. 2009, Seyfarth 2014, Tang & Shaw 2021). Arguably, the typicality of an adjective + noun sequence is closely related to the backward predictability of the adjective based on the noun, and the forward predictability of the noun based on the adjective. This link between typicality and predictability suggests that word duration is an ideal measure to investigate typicality effects. Second, the focus is on the duration of the adjective for the simple reason that while each adjective occurred in all three typicality conditions (atypi-cal, medium, typical), the nouns each only occurred in a single typicality condition. Be-cause of this, the phonological makeup of the nouns (which is inevitably the strongest predictor of word duration) is confounded with the typicality condition in which they appear. Any duration measure that involves the nouns will be affected by this confound, and even sophisticated controls for word duration (e.g. baseline durations based on speech synthesis; Seyfarth 2014) are unlikely to fully resolve this issue. Therefore, the focus here is on the adjectives only.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the independent variable(s) (predictors), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple independent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


The categorical typicality variable was chosen as the fixed effect independent variable. The rationale was simply that this seemed to align the most closely with the experimental design.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How did you operationalise your dependent and independent variables? For example, if you choose f0 as a variable, specify from which speech domain it was extracted (for example: the phrase, the word, the syllable, the vowel, etc.), whether you extracted a summary statistic over a larger domain or a concrete value at a specific or relative point in time. For categorical variables (like age, gender, etc.), specify the levels/categories, how they are operationalised and the rationale behind the categorisation.


The dependent variable was the duration of the adjective (the entire word) as measured in seconds. The independent variable, as noted above, was simply "typicality" as operationalised in the original data (atypical, medium, typical).



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What transformation (if any) were applied to the variables? Please, be as specific as possible by indicating for each variable that has been transformed the name of the variable as found in the dataset and the formula/operation that has been applied to it. For example: "We log transformed the F0 values, which are found in the column 'log_f0' of our data frame."


No transformation was applied before entering the duration values into the model – however, the lognormal model does perform a sort of a log transform internally through the link function. The rationale for using the lognormal model is that duration measurements are bounded at 0 and therefore follow a skewed distribution.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Were any observations excluded? If so, which criteria did you follow for the exclusion? For example: "We excluded values that were +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean."


Only typical / atypical combinations were examined (medium excluded), and only in the NF condition. Tokens from utterances with any text on the notes tier (typically "error") were excluded, as were tokens where there was any pause between the adjective and noun as determined by the forced aligner.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What criteria did you use to decide on an answer to the research question? For example, the decision could have been based on p-values for particular predictors and/or interactions, on Bayesian posterior distributions, or confidence/credible intervals, etc...


The decision was based on Bayesian credible intervals.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the size of the effect for the research question? Please, specify the magnitude and direction of the effect size, along with the 95% confidence (or credible) interval in the following format: estimate [low interval, high interval].


Cohen’s D: –0.028, CrI [–0.58,0.51] (typical has a lower estimated duration than atypical; raw values in log duration: –0.012 with a 95% CrI of [–0.256, 0.196])



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What unit is your effect size in (i.e., Hedges' G, standardized mean difference, etc.)?


Cohen's D

Often we do not anticipate possible road blocks during our analyses. Did you encounter scenarios in which you had to revise an earlier analytical decision at a later stage, e.g. change a measurement after you have statistically analyzed (parts of) the data? If so, please briefly describe the situation.


There were very few revisions as the analysis was designed with minimising researcher degrees of freedom in mind (within reasonable limits, of course!). One change that took place after inspecting preliminary data was to add an alternative pronunciation of "orangen" to the forced aligner and re-align the textgrids. The final model also had to be pared down slightly to address divergent transitions (but, as noted in the text & analysis script, the original non-convergent model produces the same results).

I also originally wanted to analyse the duration of the entire adjective + noun sequence. After extracting & wrangling the duration data, I realised that this was not feasible due to the fact that each noun only appears in a single typicality condition, and therefore typicality is confounded with the phonological makeup of nouns. This was, however, before running the statistical analysis, and it did not lead to any changes in the data extraction / data wrangling process.

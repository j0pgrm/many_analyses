Which software did you use for the processing of the recordings and extraction of acoustic measurements? Please indicate all pieces of software that were used, and specify what was accomplished with each. For example: "Filtering of the recordings was done using the Matlab signal processing toolbox, while the extraction of acoustic measurements (f0, duration, formants, CoG) was accomplished with Praat."


Acoustic measurements (word duration, F1, F2) were extracted using Praat. Textgrids were hand-labeled in Praat.

Which analytical/statistical technique(s) did you employ to answer the research question? Please, indicate the name of the techniques and describe specific details if necessary. For example, "We run Bayesian mixed-effects models using a Gaussian likelihood as the distribution of the outcome variable". Details about variables and parameters will be asked in later questions.


We used linear mixed-effects models with random effects for speakers.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How familiar are you with the analytical/statistical technique you employed?


Very familiar.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the dependent variable(s) (outcome or measured or latent variable), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple dependent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Based on previous findings that less predictable words are hyperarticulated relative to more predictable words (e.g., Liebermann, 1967), our driving hypothesis was that typicality might condition hyperarticulation. Specifically, less typical words (which are less predictable in their contexts) were expected to be hyperarticulated relative to more typical words (which are more predictable in their contexts). Or, conversely, more typical words were expected to be reduced relative to less typical words.
Taking a multidimensional perspective on hyperarticulation, we looked at both word duration and vowel space areas for stressed vowels in the color words. We chose to analyze the color words rather than the nouns because they are consistent throughout the experiment. 
We predicted that less typical words would be longer and would have more peripheral vowel qualities, yielding bigger vowel space areas, relative to more typical words.
We also looked at F1 and F2 to see whether there were any vowel quality differences not captured by the vowel space area measurement.

To answer the research question, which variable(s) did you choose as the independent variable(s) (predictors), and what was the rationale behind the choice? If the analysis included multiple independent variables, specify all of them and the rationale behind choosing each.


Typicality--we predicted that the color words would be hyperarticulated in atypical context compared to typical context
Vowel--we controlled for expected differences in vowel quality across vowels
Gender--we controlled for expected differences in vowel quality by gender
Speaker--we included random intercepts for each speaker to control for individual differences



------------------------------------------------------------------------



How did you operationalise your dependent and independent variables? For example, if you choose f0 as a variable, specify from which speech domain it was extracted (for example: the phrase, the word, the syllable, the vowel, etc.), whether you extracted a summary statistic over a larger domain or a concrete value at a specific or relative point in time. For categorical variables (like age, gender, etc.), specify the levels/categories, how they are operationalised and the rationale behind the categorisation.


Duration--Because several of the targets had vowels adjacent to sonorants, making precise segmentation difficult, we decided not to use vowel durations.  Instead, we used full word durations (which were compared across typicality conditions). 
F1 and F2 measures were made at 5 points across the approximately segmented vowel, and points 2 (25% of the way through the vowel) and 4 (75% of the way through the vowel) were analyzed. Since the vowel boundaries were not precise (due to the adjacent sonorants), points 2 and 4 were not at 25% and 75% exactly, but they always captured points early and late in the vowel respectively. Since one of the vowels was a diphthong (/au/), the early and late measures represent values from the nucleus and glide for that vowel.
Vowel space areas (VSA) were calculated for each speaker for each condition (typical, medium, or atypical) using the vowelMeansPolygonArea function in the PhonR package in R. That function calculated the area for a polygon in the F1/F2 vowel space defined by the 5 vowels in the color terms: /y/, /e/, /a/, /au/, and /o/, in that order.
Independent variables (gender, vowel, speaker, typicality) were operationalised as they appeared in the data we were given.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What transformation (if any) were applied to the variables? Please, be as specific as possible by indicating for each variable that has been transformed the name of the variable as found in the dataset and the formula/operation that has been applied to it. For example: "We log transformed the F0 values, which are found in the column 'log_f0' of our data frame."


Vowel space area was calculated as described above. No other transformations were applied to the data.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Were any observations excluded? If so, which criteria did you follow for the exclusion? For example: "We excluded values that were +/- 3 standard deviations from the mean."


We excluded observations labeled NA for typicality.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What criteria did you use to decide on an answer to the research question? For example, the decision could have been based on p-values for particular predictors and/or interactions, on Bayesian posterior distributions, or confidence/credible intervals, etc...


We used p-values with an alpha level 0.05.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What is the size of the effect for the research question? Please, specify the magnitude and direction of the effect size, along with the 95% confidence (or credible) interval in the following format: estimate [low interval, high interval].


We found no relevant significant effects.



------------------------------------------------------------------------



What unit is your effect size in (i.e., Hedges' G, standardized mean difference, etc.)?


NA



------------------------------------------------------------------------



Often we do not anticipate possible road blocks during our analyses. Did you encounter scenarios in which you had to revise an earlier analytical decision at a later stage, e.g. change a measurement after you have statistically analyzed (parts of) the data? If so, please briefly describe the situation.


NA
